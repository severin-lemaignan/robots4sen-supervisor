This morning, Ben is going mushroom picking with Mum and Dad.
It's been raining the whole week: it's the perfect time for picking them.
If he collects enough, Mum has promised to cook an omelette just for him, so Ben searches every single corner of the forest to bring back as many mushrooms as possible\pau=700\.
The only problem is that Ben doesn't know how to recognise them.
He has to ask Dad, who's an expert, to tell him if the mushrooms he finds are edible.
Because Ben didn't know, but not all mushrooms are edible – some can make you sick, so you have to be careful.
He shows all the mushrooms he finds, and if Dad says yes, he puts them in his basket\pau=700\.
There are different sorts. Those that grow on the ground and those that grow on tree trunks.
Some that look like trumpets, or like flowers; red ones, yellow ones, green ones, even purple ones.
There are some with round hats, while others have pointed hats.
He even sees some with no hat at all. Dad gives him the names of the mushrooms as he puts them in his basket.
There are morels and porcinis, sheep's feet and chanterelles, merules and puffballs.
Who could have imagined that there were so many different types of mushrooms?\pau=700\As the hour is getting late – and he's starting to get hungry – Ben decides to pick some final mushrooms before going home.
It would be great if he could find a big one to finish off\pau=700\.
And look, there's one right there!On a pile of moss, Ben sees the strangest mushroom of the day.
It doesn't look like any of the others that he has seen up till now\pau=700\.
First, it's bigger, much bigger than all the others, and when he gets closer to it, it looks like there are windows drawn on the mushroom, with little white lace curtains.
Ben can't believe his eyes: there's even smoke coming out of the hat!\pau=700\"This is amazing," he thinks.
"I have to show it to Dad"\pau=700\. But as he steps forward to take a closer look, he hears a voice saying:\pau=700\"Oh no, it's not going to happen again! It's always the same, you humans, always trying to pick my house with your big hands full of fingers.
Is it really that hard to tell the difference between a house and a mushroom?"\pau=700\Ben is stunned.
From the sound of the voice, the person speaking seems very cross, but when he looks around, he doesn't see anyone\pau=700\.
"Down here, just next to your feet"\pau=700\. Ben bends down to get a better look and indeed, just next to his feet he sees a little elf looking rather angry\pau=700\.
"Forgive me. I didn't see you. I just wanted to take a closer look at this mushroom".
"Yes, I'm well aware that you didn't see me. You big ones never pay attention where you step.
This is very dangerous for little people like me. And this mushroom, as you call it, happens to be my home"\pau=700\.
"Is it? But your house is the spitting image of a mushroom"\pau=700\.
"Have you ever seen a mushroom with windows and smoke coming out of its roof? No? Well me neither, my boy.
It's my home and I built it myself. It's here that I heal the small animals from the forest when they're sick.
I'm the forest doctor"\pau=700\. Ben finds this fantastic. A forest doctor.
Fancy that\pau=700\. "Is that why you live alone in the woods?"\pau=700\The elf has calmed down, seeing that Ben is interested in what he does and is no longer trying to pick his home\pau=700\.
"Yes, that's why I live here. To be able to heal animals when they need me, and also because the mushrooms I need to cook my healing potion only grow in this forest.
I was going to look for some when I saw you hanging around my house"\pau=700\.
Ben is sorry, one more minute and he would have snatched the poor little elf's house\pau=700\.
"Can I do something to be forgiven?" "Well, now that you mention it... I'm a bit tired and I see that you"re carrying a basket full of mushrooms.
Would you agree to swap it for this basket of chestnuts I've picked this morning?"\pau=700\Ben is a bit reluctant to give all his mushrooms away, but if that'll help with healing the animals, then there's no need to hesitate.
He hands his basket of mushrooms over and takes the chestnuts instead\pau=700\.
"Thanks a lot," says the elf. "If you ever come back here, don't hesitate to visit me, I would be delighted to welcome you".
He winks at him. "You and your mushrooms, of course"\pau=700\.
Ben winks back at the elf and returns to find Mum and Dad waiting for him to go back home\pau=700\.
"What have you done with your mushrooms?" Dad asks, looking surprised when he sees that instead of having a basket full of mushrooms, Ben has returned with a basket full of chestnuts\pau=700\.
"I changed my mind," he replies. "Instead of a mushroom omelette, I want chestnut soup".
Dad looks at Mum, who nods. "Chestnut soup it is, then"\pau=700\.
And Ben, lulled by the noise of the car, falls asleep with a wide smile, thinking about all the animals that will be healed thanks to the mushrooms he gave to the elf.
