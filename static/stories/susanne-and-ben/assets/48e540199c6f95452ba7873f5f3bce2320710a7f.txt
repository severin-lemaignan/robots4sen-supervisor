This morning, Ben is going mushroom picking with Mum and Dad.
If he collects enough, Mum has promised to cook an omelette just for him, so Ben searches every single corner of the forest to bring back as many mushrooms as possible\pau=700\.
He has to ask Dad, who's an expert, to tell him if the mushrooms he finds are edible.
He shows all the mushrooms he finds, and if Dad says yes, he puts them in his basket\pau=700\.
Those that grow on the ground and those that grow on tree trunks.
There are some with round hats, while others have pointed hats.
Dad gives him the names of the mushrooms as he puts them in his basket.
Who could have imagined that there were so many different types of mushrooms?\pau=700\As the hour is getting late – and he's starting to get hungry – Ben decides to pick some final mushrooms before going home.
And look, there's one right there!On a pile of moss, Ben sees the strangest mushroom of the day.
First, it's bigger, much bigger than all the others, and when he gets closer to it, it looks like there are windows drawn on the mushroom, with little white lace curtains.
"I have to show it to Dad"\pau=700\. But as he steps forward to take a closer look, he hears a voice saying:\pau=700\"Oh no, it's not going to happen again! It's always the same, you humans, always trying to pick my house with your big hands full of fingers.
From the sound of the voice, the person speaking seems very cross, but when he looks around, he doesn't see anyone\pau=700\.
Ben bends down to get a better look and indeed, just next to his feet he sees a little elf looking rather angry\pau=700\.
I didn't see you. I just wanted to take a closer look at this mushroom".
You big ones never pay attention where you step. This is very dangerous for little people like me.
"Is it? But your house is the spitting image of a mushroom"\pau=700\.
It's my home and I built it myself. It's here that I heal the small animals from the forest when they're sick.
Ben finds this fantastic. A forest doctor. Fancy that\pau=700\.
"Yes, that's why I live here. To be able to heal animals when they need me, and also because the mushrooms I need to cook my healing potion only grow in this forest.
Ben is sorry, one more minute and he would have snatched the poor little elf's house\pau=700\.
Would you agree to swap it for this basket of chestnuts I've picked this morning?"\pau=700\Ben is a bit reluctant to give all his mushrooms away, but if that"ll help with healing the animals, then there's no need to hesitate.
"Thanks a lot," says the elf. "If you ever come back here, don't hesitate to visit me, I would be delighted to welcome you".
"You and your mushrooms, of course"\pau=700\. Ben winks back at the elf and returns to find Mum and Dad waiting for him to go back home\pau=700\.
"I changed my mind," he replies. "Instead of a mushroom omelette, I want chestnut soup".
"Chestnut soup it is, then"\pau=700\. And Ben, lulled by the noise of the car, falls asleep with a wide smile, thinking about all the animals that will be healed thanks to the mushrooms he gave to the elf.
