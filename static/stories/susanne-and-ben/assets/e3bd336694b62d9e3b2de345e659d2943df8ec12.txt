After lunch, Suzanne always takes a walk in the forest to help digest.
She loves breathing in the fresh air and hearing the birds sing, and from time to time she picks berries for her dessert\pau=700\.
As she walks everywhere, she knows the forest very well! She could even walk with her eyes closed, and she would still be able to find her way.
By the way, that's what she's doing today, just to prove to herself that she can do it.
She recites the way in her head\pau=700\. Straight ahead, to the forked tree, turn, turn and turn again up to the big clearing, keeping going, then turn right, then turn the left, and there we are! But when she opens her eyes, surprise! She's not at all in the grove where she usually picks blueberries and strawberries.
Instead, there's a rather run-down house with a garden full of weeds and an old well\pau=700\.
Gosh! She thought she had seen everything in the forest, but clearly there are still some areas to discover!\pau=700\"Excellent!" thinks Suzanne.
"An abandoned cabin. I'm sure I'm going to have lots of new adventures"\pau=700\.
She knocks on the door. Maybe it's a witch's house, and Suzanne doesn't want to be changed into a frog.
She opens the door. Nobody there. "Is anyone home?" she asks.
No answer. The house looks empty despite the kettle whistling and the biscuits on the table.
It looks like someone was making tea but didn't return to drink it.
It reminds Suzanne that it's almost snack time, and she's starting to get a bit hungry.
She wishes she could have one of the biscuits, but she doesn't dare take one\pau=700\.
"Hello, I'm a bit hungry, do you mind if I take a biscuit?" Still no answer.
Suzanne shouts a little louder: "Is anybody home?" She hears a sound from afar.
It sounds like it's coming from the garden, from the old well\pau=700\.
"Help! Help!" she hears a weak voice cry out\pau=700\. Someone's calling for help.
Suzanne goes to see who it is and leans over the well, but it's too deep and she can't see a thing.
She turns her flashlight on, which never leaves her side, to see a bit better.
The house is not abandoned: it belongs to a witch who fell into the well\pau=700\.
"Help! Help me, my child; I was trying to pick mint for my tea, but I slipped and fell over"\pau=700\.
Suzanne is a bit suspicious. She has heard stories where witches live in gingerbread houses and trap children to then eat them\pau=700\.
"How do I know that you're not going to eat me if I help you?"\pau=700\The witch whispers.
"You too have heard all sorts of stories about mean witches, haven't you? But don't worry, I'm a kind witch and my house is not made of gingerbread.
If you help me out, I will give you a reward"\pau=700\. Suzanne is not reassured, but she can't leave the witch in the well.
She might drown. She takes the rope besides the well and throws it down so the witch can climb up the well.
When the witch gets to the top, she's all soaked and big puddles form at her feet\pau=700\.
"Thanks a lot," she tells her. "I really thought I was going to stay in there forever".
Suzanne doesn't answer; she's a bit scared. "Is it my appearance that frightens you?" the witch asks.
"Don't you worry"\pau=700\. "Alakabrim!" With one flick of her magic wand, the witch dries herself.
Her hat, which was flopping all over her face, rises back up, and her boots, which were going splosh-splosh, don't make any more noise.
"Ahhh! That's much better like this. Do I still scare you?"\pau=700\At that moment, Suzanne's stomach starts growling again.
The witch laughs out loud; she is no longer scary when she laughs\pau=700\.
"I see you're hungry. Come and have a snack with me, and then I'll give you your reward.
Do you like biscuits?"\pau=700\Once Suzanne has her belly full, she tells the kind witch how she got lost in the woods\pau=700\.
"You remind me of myself when I was younger. Always running wild.
But I see where you went wrong. If you want to go home, you must turn left, left and then right after the forked tree, and then you will find your way back.
You can come back to see me when you want; we'll have a snack together again.
And as I promised you a reward, would you like this basket of blueberries and strawberries I've picked this morning?"\pau=700\Suzanne is very pleased.
Maybe she got lost but she found a new friend, and with the basket of strawberries and blueberries, she will be able to make some lovely tarts with her mother for tonight's dessert.
