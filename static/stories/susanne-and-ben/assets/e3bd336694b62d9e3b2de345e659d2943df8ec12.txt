After lunch, Suzanne always takes a walk in the forest to help digest.
As she walks everywhere, she knows the forest very well! She could even walk with her eyes closed, and she would still be able to find her way.
She recites the way in her head\pau=700\. Straight ahead, to the forked tree, turn, turn and turn again up to the big clearing, keeping going, then turn right, then turn the left, and there we are! But when she opens her eyes, surprise! She's not at all in the grove where she usually picks blueberries and strawberries.
Gosh! She thought she had seen everything in the forest, but clearly there are still some areas to discover!\pau=700\"Excellent!" thinks Suzanne.
I'm sure I'm going to have lots of new adventures"\pau=700\. She knocks on the door.
She opens the door. Nobody there. "Is anyone home?" she asks.
The house looks empty despite the kettle whistling and the biscuits on the table.
It reminds Suzanne that it's almost snack time, and she's starting to get a bit hungry.
"Hello, I'm a bit hungry, do you mind if I take a biscuit?" Still no answer.
It sounds like it's coming from the garden, from the old well\pau=700\.
Someone's calling for help. Suzanne goes to see who it is and leans over the well, but it's too deep and she can't see a thing.
The house is not abandoned: it belongs to a witch who fell into the well\pau=700\.
Suzanne is a bit suspicious. She has heard stories where witches live in gingerbread houses and trap children to then eat them\pau=700\.
"You too have heard all sorts of stories about mean witches, haven't you? But don't worry, I'm a kind witch and my house is not made of gingerbread.
Suzanne is not reassured, but she can't leave the witch in the well.
She takes the rope besides the well and throws it down so the witch can climb up the well.
"Thanks a lot," she tells her. "I really thought I was going to stay in there forever".
"Is it my appearance that frightens you?" the witch asks. "Don't you worry"\pau=700\.
Her hat, which was flopping all over her face, rises back up, and her boots, which were going splosh-splosh, don't make any more noise.
Do I still scare you?"\pau=700\At that moment, Suzanne's stomach starts growling again.
"I see you're hungry. Come and have a snack with me, and then I'll give you your reward.
"You remind me of myself when I was younger. Always running wild.
If you want to go home, you must turn left, left and then right after the forked tree, and then you will find your way back.
And as I promised you a reward, would you like this basket of blueberries and strawberries I've picked this morning?"\pau=700\Suzanne is very pleased.
