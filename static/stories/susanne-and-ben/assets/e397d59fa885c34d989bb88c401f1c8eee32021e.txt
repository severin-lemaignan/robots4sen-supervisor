Ben was sound asleep, lost in a world of dreams, when something patted him on the nose.
"Wakey-wakey," said the fairy boy. "Time for your birthday wish, little Tim".
"Um... hi!" he said. "I'm really sorry, but my name isn't Tim, it's Ben…"The fairy boy's smile faded.
"Oh no! No, no, no... Not that! Please not that..."Then he faced Ben again.
"I think I would remember that," replied Ben with a smile. "It's okay though, everybody makes mistakes".
"Today is my first day, and they"re going to scold me for being in the wrong house... And I'm already in trouble because of my Wish Magic".
"Well, in Fairy School, most of my spells tended to end up with very strange results...""It's all right," said Ben.
I"ll help you if you like". "Really?" asked the Fairy. "You would do that?""Sure, why not? Here, show me what you can do".
He stumbled upon an old pair of shoes, worn at both ends, and so filled with holes that they looked like Swiss cheese with laces.
"Let's start with the classics," he said. "Try and turn them into glass slippers".
"I told you, my spells tend to backfire... badly!""It's all right," replied Ben, "I have faith in you".
Stardust filled the room, shining brightly, and he cast his spell, muttering under his breath like crazy:"Glass slippers, glass slippers, glass slippers..."The old worn shoes flew across the room, and instead of wonderful glass slippers, turned into dreadful grasshoppers that started jumping everywhere.
Ben, who didn't like bugs very much, had climbed on a chair. "It's okay," he said, "we"ll try again.
"Bouncing ball, bouncing ball, bouncing ball," he said quickly.
The hairy pig looked absolutely stunned to be there, bouncing up and down on the floor.
"It's getting worse and worse!"Ben was laughing so hard at the animal's puzzled face.
"Try again; turn him into a pink rabbit, just for fun!"The fairy flew in the face of the boar and screamed at the top of his lungs:"Pink rabbit, pink rabbit, pink rabbit!"Another stardust explosion later, a giant pink robot was standing in the room, crouched under the ceiling.
"Really?" asked the fairy hopefully. "Yes; it's because you keep saying the spells three times! Everybody knows that if you repeat something too rapidly, your tongue will twist every time! Here, try saying “black bug bit a big black bear” three times quickly".
"You see," said Ben, "it's impossible! You should try saying your spells only once! Try again with the robot; turn it back into my old shoes".
"Yay!" shrieked the fairy. "It worked! I can't believe it! Now I can go and find little Tim, he's going to have the best birthday wish ever!"He went up to the window, stopped and turned back.
"As a thank-you for all your precious help?"Ben looked at the old pair of shoes in his hands and said with a smile:"How about the nice pink robot again?"A few minutes later, the fairy flew into the night, on the way to a little boy's home, finally happy with his magic powers.
