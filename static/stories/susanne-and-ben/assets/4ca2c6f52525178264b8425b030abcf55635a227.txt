Ben lost his tooth! When it fell he put it in his drawer for the tooth fairy, but now he can't find it. No matter how many times he looks for it in all the drawers of his desk, no trace of his tooth. How strange!\pau=700\
He asks Dad if he has seen his tooth by any chance.\pau=700\
"Have you looked in the living room cabinet? I think I saw some of your toys in there."\pau=700\
Maybe Ben has put his tooth with his toys by mistake. You never know, so he'd better check. In the living room, Ben looks again and again in the cabinet, but finds nothing at all. There's only his construction game box and a plastic soldier with one missing leg.\pau=700\
"You should ask Mum, she might have seen it somewhere," says Dad.\pau=700\
Ben asks Mum if she has seen his tooth by any chance, but she can't remember.\pau=700\
"You should look in the dresser. Perhaps it is there."\pau=700\
Ben searches the dresser, but again, no tooth. Only a plastic car with a wheel missing and a board game.\pau=700\
Ben is rather annoyed, but he hopes that the tooth fairy won't hold it too much against him.\pau=700\
In the night, he's awoken by a little pat on the nose. It's the tooth fairy, who looks at him angrily.\pau=700\
"Is that you, Ben?"\pau=700\
"It is," Ben answers, half-asleep.\pau=700\
"On my list, it's written that I must deliver a coin in exchange for a tooth, but when I looked under your pillow, there was nothing at all. It isn't very kind of you to waste my time; it's already very late and I've got plenty of other children to see tonight."\pau=700\
Ben apologises and tries to explain to the fairy that he can't find his tooth, but she's in a hurry and doesn't want to know.\pau=700\
"No tooth, no coin. That's the rule. If someone knows that I've given a coin without receiving a tooth in exchange, I'll get in trouble."\pau=700\
But faced with Ben's sad expression, the fairy softens.\pau=700\
"Well, as I see that you're not a liar; I'm going to help you look for your tooth. The quicker we find it, the quicker I can go back to my deliveries."\pau=700\
Ben and the tooth fairy search and search Ben's bedroom to find his tooth, when suddenly he remembers. He didn't put it in his drawer, but in the pocket of his trousers! He hurries to the basket of dirty laundry, picks up his trousers, looks into the pocket and... there's the tooth, lodged right at the bottom. It's a nice canine, which he is going to give to the tooth fairy. She ticks a box on her list, gives him his coin in exchange and takes off.\pau=700\
The night is long and she hasn't finished her rounds...
