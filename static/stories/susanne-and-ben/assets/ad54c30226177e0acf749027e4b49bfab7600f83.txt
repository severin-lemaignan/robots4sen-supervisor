Deep in the forest, only minutes away from the city, a child was rolling in the warm grass laughing, making the birds fly out of the surrounding trees.
The little girl turned around to answer with a rather sad face.
Can't we play a bit more before going back?"Suzanne was right – the orangey, almost red sun was still in sight at the other end of the glade, above the treetops.
She didn't want to go back. "Please, Mum, just one game of hide-and-seek and then we go! I promise!"Her mother raised her eyes to the sky.
The little Suzanne leaped up to her feet. "Start counting!" she shouted to her mum.
Her eyes were scanning around for the best hiding place. No, not behind that bush, it would be too easy to find her.
Not there either, or there, or there. Then suddenly, as she heard the voice of her mother finishing counting, she saw a big rock.
As the young girl tried her best to be as quiet as a mouse, shrinking against the rock, a little grumpy voice sounded at her feet.
Curious, Suzanne lowered her head, then she opened her eyes as wide as possible to make sure she wasn't dreaming.
Suzanne realised that the elf's cries, without the cover of the birds' noise, rang out loudly in the calm forest.
The little elf jumped back when he heard that someone was addressing him.
"Excuse me, little sir", she whispered, rather confused, "I'm as surprised as you are, but if my mum finds me here, I"ll have to go back to town and I don't want to".
After a moment of hesitation, Suzanne introduced herself. "I'm Suzanne.
With a shy gesture and forcing himself to smile, he answered:"Pleased to meet you, big Suzanne.
He is the greatest elf of our time. But I won't be his apprentice for much longer... After what happened to me, I can wave goodbye to magic.
The little elf then flattened his hat onto his head, snivelling:"But a wicked magpie stole it from me during one of my naps.
But by gum, I'm way too small and there's nothing I can do". Suzanne smiled kindly at him.
The little elf jumped with joy. "By gum! You would do that? You're as kind as you are tall!"And Gnuf hurried onto her shoulder.
Eventually they got to the top. Frightened, the pilfering magpie flew away, squawking with concern.
But as she leaned in to inspect the nest, she saw three chicks stirring and playing with the keyring.
"We can't take their toy away from them, they're so cute". "But I need the keys," the elf said.
"You only need the keys; you can give them the key ring. That way they can still have fun and you can open the magical library.
"You're right, that's an excellent idea!"Suzanne grabbed the key ring with care and took off the keys attached to it – they were tiny.
The magpie returned to its children immediately. Gnuf was jumping with joy on her shoulder.
"Hurry up, take the keys and hide yourself," said Suzanne to the elf, which he did immediately.
"I'm here," she said, waving arms. "Ah, at last," replied her mother with a sigh of relief.
Come now, it's time to go home". And as they both went back, Suzanne looked over her shoulder.
