"Where did they all go?" Suzanne is visiting a castle with her class, and now she can't find her classmates.
Suzanne takes the stairs four at a time. Nobody there. Perhaps they went down instead? Suzanne hurtles down the stairs.
She opens a door, rushes into a narrow corridor, turns left, opens another door, turns around, doubles back... Not a peep.
But nobody answers. The castle is huge, and with all these rooms and corridors that look alike, it's a real maze.
Suzanne imagines her parents waiting for her in front of the school, surely very worried... What if nobody ever finds her? What if she remains in this castle for her whole life? Suzanne feels her throat tightening and tears stinging her eyes, when she hears someone sneezing beside her.
But there is nobody there. "Atishoo!" "Bless you!" Suzanne replies.
"You never know, it might be a ghost"\pau=700\. "Do you have a tissue?" asks a voice.
The corridor is still empty. "Where are you?" Suzanne asks the voice.
"So it is actually a ghost!" Suzanne tells herself. "Well, when is that tissue coming?" the voice says impatiently.
She hands a tissue to the void and it flies off like magic! Suzanne smiles.
"Don't laugh," the ghost forbids her, "do you think these wet corridors and all these drafts amuse me?" "I didn't think a ghost could catch cold," Suzanne apologises.
Suzanne thinks of her friends. She asks: "Did you see a group of kids?" "No," answers the ghost.
But since you did me a favour, I"ll help you find your class".
The tissue flies through the castle at top speed and the little girl almost has to run not to lose sight of it.
However, the tissue has disappeared. "Goodbye!" says Suzanne into the void, hoping that the ghost heard her.
Suzanne promises, and to thank the ghost, she offers him her hat.
Ever since that day, some people swear that they have seen a hat strolling alone in the castle.
