Suzanne is visiting a castle with her parents. How boring! "How bored I am," she moans.
If only she could find someone to talk to, to make the time go faster...\pau=700\Look! In the throne room she sees a broom on the wall.
"Bring me my new dress! Clean the floor, it's all dirty. Hurry up!"\pau=700\Suzanne has loads of fun, but when she wants to sit on the throne, she hears a voice saying:\pau=700\"I wouldn't do that if I were you"\pau=700\.
She tries to sit down once again, but...\pau=700\"It's a bad idea.
Suzanne takes a look around but she still can't see anyone. Maybe someone's playing a joke on her.
"I'm here. Can't you see me? Next to the door"\pau=700\. Indeed, next to the door Suzanne sees a transparent shape floating in the air\pau=700\.
"I am. By the way, it's my broom that you"re holding in your hands; I need it to sweep.
Even when there's no little girl to give us orders"\pau=700\.
I didn't want to be rude, but I was bored and the broom was there, so I took it"\pau=700\.
She's very strict, and you were about to sit on her throne. If I were you I wouldn't touch a thing"\pau=700\.
All right. You win. I"ll give you the broom back and I won't touch anything else, and in exchange you can show me around the castle.
The ghost takes his broom back and shows Suzanne around the castle, telling her how people used to live in medieval times.
"And here is the penultimate room," the ghost finally says. "I hope you had fun.
Just at that moment the guide, who was so boring, comes into the room with Suzanne's parents\pau=700\.
"You missed most of the tour"\pau=700\. Suzanne winks at the ghost, who hid in a corner, and responds: "Not at all.
Mum and Dad look at each other in surprise, but Suzanne laughs and takes them to the last room to finish the tour.
