Suzanne is visiting a castle with her parents. How boring! "How bored I am," she moans. She thought she would learn plenty of things about medieval times, but the only thing she's learned is that she's having no fun at all. If only she could find someone to talk to, to make the time go faster...\pau=700\
Look! In the throne room she sees a broom on the wall. She takes it and pretends that it's a sceptre, that she is the queen and that she's giving orders to her servants.\pau=700\
"Bring me my new dress! Clean the floor, it's all dirty. Hurry up!"\pau=700\
Suzanne has loads of fun, but when she wants to sit on the throne, she hears a voice saying:\pau=700\
"I wouldn't do that if I were you."\pau=700\
Suzanne turns around, but there's no one there. She tries to sit down once again, but...\pau=700\
"It's a bad idea. If the queen sees you she will be very angry."\pau=700\
Suzanne takes a look around but she still can't see anyone. Maybe someone's playing a joke on her. She looks behind the throne but there's no one there either.\pau=700\
"I'm here. Can't you see me? Next to the door."\pau=700\
Indeed, next to the door Suzanne sees a transparent shape floating in the air.\pau=700\
"Excuse me, but are you a ghost?" asks Suzanne.\pau=700\
"I am. By the way, it's my broom that you"re holding in your hands; I need it to sweep. The castle doesn't clean itself, you know. Even when there's no little girl to give us orders."\pau=700\
"Oh, sorry. I didn't want to be rude, but I was bored and the broom was there, so I took it."\pau=700\
"That doesn't bother me, but the ghost of the queen doesn't like people touching her things. She's very strict, and you were about to sit on her throne. If I were you I wouldn't touch a thing."\pau=700\
"Hmm. All right. You win. I"ll give you the broom back and I won't touch anything else, and in exchange you can show me around the castle. What do you say?"\pau=700\
"I show you around and you won't touch anything else?"\pau=700\
"Cross my heart!"\pau=700\
"Okay, that's a deal."\pau=700\
The ghost takes his broom back and shows Suzanne around the castle, telling her how people used to live in medieval times. He's very knowledgeable and teaches Suzanne plenty of things. "And here is the penultimate room," the ghost finally says. "I hope you had fun. We're getting to the end of the tour."\pau=700\
Just at that moment the guide, who was so boring, comes into the room with Suzanne's parents.\pau=700\
"Oh, so that's where you were," exclaims her dad. "You missed most of the tour."\pau=700\
Suzanne winks at the ghost, who hid in a corner, and responds: "Not at all. I've actually had a very good guide."\pau=700\
Mum and Dad look at each other in surprise, but Suzanne laughs and takes them to the last room to finish the tour.
