When he spends his holidays at the seaside, what Ben loves the most is fishing for shrimp.
"What a pretty shrimp!" Ben tells himself, leaning over a puddle of seawater.
But a prawn with hair, that doesn't exist. What can it be, then?" Ben wonders.
But who ever heard of a fish with hair? And a nose? And a mouth? Gosh! This animal is neither a shrimp, nor a fish.
Her turquoise scales shine like precious stones and her hair has red highlights under the sun.
It's the first time that he has met a real mermaid. He can already imagine the face that his friends will make during break time...\pau=700\Then the mermaid opens her mouth and moans: "Water! Water! I'm drying out!" Ben can't believe it! A mermaid who speaks! He wishes so much that his teacher could see this, she who claims that mermaids only exist in stories.
But instead of going away, the mermaid stares at him with her big black eyes: "Please, take me with you! I'm so bored in this puddle!" "Okay," Ben says, and he puts the mermaid into a water-filled bucket\pau=700\.
"I'm hungry!" says the mermaid. Ben doesn't have a clue what mermaids eat.
Ben picks the first thing he can find in the kitchen: a pack of Cheddar.
"I don't know, but I do want to taste it," the mermaid says. Ben cuts her a little slice.
The next morning at breakfast, Ben can't stop yawning, and his mother asks him: "Didn't you sleep well, honey?" "I've been talking all night long to a mermaid I met at the beach," Ben answers.
A few days later, as Ben returns from school, he hears the mermaid complaining: "I am very cramped in this bucket".
"I'm hungry!" the mermaid says. Ben goes to see in the kitchen if there is some Cheddar left, when he runs into his father looking for the tub to do the dishes.
"I see..." his father says, thinking that his son must really have great imagination\pau=700\.
"I am very cramped in this basin," she complains to Ben when he returns from school.
Her tail now pokes out of the tub, and she has to fold up her arms to keep her head under water.
There's only one solution. He takes the tub to the bathroom and runs a bath in the huge bathtub.
When the parents come into the bathroom to brush their teeth, they utter a frightful cry.
But his parents don't want to know. They make him bring the mermaid back to where he found her.
This mermaid is so beautiful and she sings so well. But Ben's father has already strapped the bathtub to the roof of the car.
On the beach, Ben and his friend are very sad to have to say farewell.
