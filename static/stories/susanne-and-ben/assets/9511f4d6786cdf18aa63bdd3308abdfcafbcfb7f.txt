"One, two, three, four, five, six... six strawberries! Yet it will take a lot more than that to make a tart," Ben thinks, his nose in the grass, a bit discouraged.
Ben decides to go and look elsewhere, but as he gets up to continue on his way, he doesn't recognise anything: the path has disappeared.
How can he find his way back to the road? Fortunately, Ben is used to excursions in the forest, and he never leaves without a flashlight.
He gropes around as if he was going through cotton, until the moment he comes face to face with a door.
"I could come in and wait for the fog to clear"\pau=700\. The door opens with a big creak.
No answer. Ben enters the house: it is dark and the room is in an unimaginable mess.
"Compared to this place, my bedroom is really tidy. Who can live in such a mess?" At the far end of the room, sat in an armchair, an old lady smiles at him: "Come closer my little boy, it's been so long since I have received a visit!" Ben directs his flashlight towards the old lady: hooked nose, pointed chin, crooked hat â€“ no doubt about it, she must be a witch! Ben rushes towards the door to flee, but it's too late.
"Now that I have you, don't count on leaving anytime soon!" The witch casts an eye over Ben's basket.
Strawberry and little-boy flavoured ice cream, that should be very tasty".
While the witch looks for utensils to prepare the ice cream, Ben has an idea.
When the witch turns around, she sees the giant shadow and remains speechless.
The witch lets out a terrible howl: "A monster! A monster in my house!" She drops all her utensils and runs away.
Since that day, when Ben eats a strawberry ice cream, he smiles, thinking back to the witch... "Why are you laughing, Ben?" his daddy asks.
