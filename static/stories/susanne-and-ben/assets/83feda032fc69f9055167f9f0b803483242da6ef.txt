Mum and Dad have taken a day off. A day off for both of them.
It's worth pointing out that this is a very rare event. It's good timing, because Ben is also on holiday.
And what if they took the opportunity to go out? All together.
Out into the cold. No sooner said than done. Arm in arm, off they all go, out treasure hunting.
Dad wearing his windbreaker, Mum her winter coat. And Ben? And Ben wearing his winter coat too, of course!\pau=700\Off they go, into the bleak morning.
But where to find a treasure when you don't know where to look?\pau=700\No one to help?\pau=700\They ask the sailor on his yacht, they ask Oscar the lighthouse keeper, but nobody knows where to look\pau=700\.
"We will have to figure it out ourselves," Dad says in his nice, deep voice.
"Let's look under this lime tree," Mum says in her beautiful, soft voice.
"I can't see anything," Ben says in a trumpet-like voice. "I've forgotten my glasses"\pau=700\.
They search and search. No treasure under this tree\pau=700\.
Then off they go again, back into the grey midday\pau=700\. "We'll have to search and search and search," Dad tells them in a determined voice.
"What if we looked under this palm?" Mum asks in a calm voice.
"I'm trying, I'm trying," Ben replies. "But the roots are too high and I'm very small"\pau=700\.
No one to help them?\pau=700\Off they go again, back into the dusk of the early evening\pau=700\.
Dad is giving up, Mum wants to sit down, but Ben? Ben is still hopeful!\pau=700\He hears a sound from afar\pau=700\.
Ho, ho, ho, we're on the oceanHo, ho, ho, we're fighting against the wind\pau=700\It's an old pirate dressed in a bathrobe walking with a limp.
Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop. He's got a golden tooth and a wooden leg.
He addresses himself to Ben:\pau=700\"Good evening, young sailor.
What brings you here? I assume that you and your parents are in distress.
Tell me your woes"\pau=700\. Ben tells him the whole story. How they went to look for treasure but are still empty-handed\pau=700\.
What a good joke! The good old pirate laughs so much that he runs out of breath.
"Is that your worry? That you haven't found my treasure? To you I'm happy to reveal its location of my treasure.
You won't find it in these parts. I've hidden it not far from here, close to the sea, under a green coconut tree.
No need to thank me, you and your parents can dig it up"\pau=700\.
With these words, the pirate goes back the way he came, limping\pau=700\.
Ho, ho, ho, I want to see some mermaidsHa, ha, ha, I, the big captain\pau=700\The parents heard everything.
They go with Ben to the beach, find the coconut tree and dig.
And what do they find? In the chest that they open?\pau=700\Tickets to be part of the pirate's crew! They'll get to carry swords and climb trees and live the life of adventure out in the wild\pau=700\.
When they arrive at the boat, the old pirate in his bathrobe is already there and motions for them to come aboard\pau=700\.
Ho, ho, hoMy new sailorsI hope you're not scared of the waterHoist the mainsail, we"re headed for the stars\pau=700\And suddenly, the boat rises up, heads towards the sky and disappears into the night.
Ben and his parents aren't scared: they know they're now part of the pirate's crew and that they"re safe\pau=700\.
What became of them?Well, if you look carefully at the sky on cloudless nights, you'll see falling stars.
