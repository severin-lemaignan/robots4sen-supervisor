Mum and Dad have taken a day off. A day off for both of them.
It's good timing, because Ben is also on holiday. And what if they took the opportunity to go out? All together.
No sooner said than done. Arm in arm, off they all go, out treasure hunting.
And Ben? And Ben wearing his winter coat too, of course!\pau=700\Off they go, into the bleak morning.
"We will have to figure it out ourselves," Dad says in his nice, deep voice.
"I can't see anything," Ben says in a trumpet-like voice. "I've forgotten my glasses"\pau=700\.
No treasure under this tree\pau=700\. Then off they go again, back into the grey midday\pau=700\.
"What if we looked under this palm?" Mum asks in a calm voice.
"But the roots are too high and I'm very small"\pau=700\. No one to help them?\pau=700\Off they go again, back into the dusk of the early evening\pau=700\.
Ho, ho, ho, we're on the oceanHo, ho, ho, we're fighting against the wind\pau=700\It's an old pirate dressed in a bathrobe walking with a limp.
He's got a golden tooth and a wooden leg. He addresses himself to Ben:\pau=700\"Good evening, young sailor.
Tell me your woes"\pau=700\. Ben tells him the whole story. How they went to look for treasure but are still empty-handed\pau=700\.
"Is that your worry? That you haven't found my treasure? To you I'm happy to reveal its location of my treasure.
I've hidden it not far from here, close to the sea, under a green coconut tree.
With these words, the pirate goes back the way he came, limping\pau=700\.
They go with Ben to the beach, find the coconut tree and dig.
When they arrive at the boat, the old pirate in his bathrobe is already there and motions for them to come aboard\pau=700\.
Ben and his parents aren't scared: they know they're now part of the pirate's crew and that they"re safe\pau=700\.
