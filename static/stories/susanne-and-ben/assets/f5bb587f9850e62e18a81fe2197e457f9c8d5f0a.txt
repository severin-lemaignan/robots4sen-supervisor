Suzanne is about to go for a walk in the castle of her friend Veronica, when she suddenly hears a thunderous sound.
Big tears are rolling down his cheeks and creating a puddle at his feet.
"What makes me so sad? What makes me so sad?" the ogre sobs. "It's that my fiancée has gone on a trip.
Suzanne offers to lend him her four-colour pen, but the ogre refuses\pau=700\.
If I write a letter with such a feather, my feelings will go directly to her heart without going by the postman.
And the ogre resumes his crying. The puddle under his feet gets bigger and bigger, until it creates a little pond.
So she decides to help him\pau=700\. "If you want, I will help you find the most beautiful feather in the realm so that you can write to your fiancée"\pau=700\.
"Yes, of course. I'm going to start searching immediately. Come with me: together it"ll be quicker"\pau=700\.
Suzanne questions all the guards, all the servants and all the people living in the castle, but no one knows where to find the most beautiful goose in the realm.
She also tells her to be careful, because the goose has a bad temper and likes to bite the calves of little girls.
"What is it for?"\pau=700\The cook was not mistaken: the goose really has a bad temper.
"Why should I care? The ogre needs my feather but I do need a pond for my chicks.
Everyone has their troubles". And as the goose finishes saying this, it tries to bite Suzanne's calves\pau=700\.
He cries so much that in less than five minutes, he finds himself in the middle of a huge pond\pau=700\.
"Now your chicks have a place to bathe. And it's thanks to the ogre.
Suzanne thanks the goose politely and gives the feather to the ogre, so he can write to his fiancée\pau=700\.
The ogre has been able to write his letter, the goose has been able to bathe with its chicks and Suzanne has done a good deed.
