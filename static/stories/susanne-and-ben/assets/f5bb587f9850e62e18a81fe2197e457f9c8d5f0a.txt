Suzanne is about to go for a walk in the castle of her friend Veronica, when she suddenly hears a thunderous sound. Bwahuhuhu! Bwahuhuhu! It's a crying ogre. Big tears are rolling down his cheeks and creating a puddle at his feet. "What makes you so sad?" asks Suzanne. "What makes me so sad? What makes me so sad?" the ogre sobs. "It's that my fiancée has gone on a trip. It's been a long time since I saw her and I can't write to tell her that I love her, for I've broken my feather."\pau=700\
Suzanne offers to lend him her four-colour pen, but the ogre refuses.\pau=700\
"I need the most beautiful feather from the most beautiful goose in the realm. If I write a letter with such a feather, my feelings will go directly to her heart without going by the postman. Now that it is broken, she will never know how much I love her."\pau=700\
And the ogre resumes his crying. The puddle under his feet gets bigger and bigger, until it creates a little pond. Suzanne feels bad for the ogre. So she decides to help him.\pau=700\
"If you want, I will help you find the most beautiful feather in the realm so that you can write to your fiancée."\pau=700\
"You would do this for me?" the ogre replies.\pau=700\
"Yes, of course. I'm going to start searching immediately. Come with me: together it"ll be quicker."\pau=700\
The ogre dries his tears, which have ended up forming a small river, and goes with Suzanne in search of the most beautiful feather from the most beautiful goose in the realm.\pau=700\
Suzanne questions all the guards, all the servants and all the people living in the castle, but no one knows where to find the most beautiful goose in the realm. Except the older of the cooks, who tells her that the most beautiful goose in the realm in here, in the hen house of the castle. She also tells her to be careful, because the goose has a bad temper and likes to bite the calves of little girls. Suzanne thanks the old cook and runs to the hen house to speak to the most beautiful goose in the realm.\pau=700\
"What is it for?"\pau=700\
The cook was not mistaken: the goose really has a bad temper. Suzanne tries to tell it all about the ogre's love troubles, but the goose interrupts her before she even finishes her story.\pau=700\
"Why should I care? The ogre needs my feather but I do need a pond for my chicks. It's way too hot and they have no place to cool off. Everyone has their troubles." And as the goose finishes saying this, it tries to bite Suzanne's calves.\pau=700\
Hearing this, the ogre, who hasn't said a word since the start, resumes his crying again. He cries so much that in less than five minutes, he finds himself in the middle of a huge pond.\pau=700\
"Here's your pond," says Suzanne. "Now your chicks have a place to bathe. And it's thanks to the ogre. Would you please give him your most beautiful feather?'\pau=700\
The goose is so happy with the new pond that it gives its most beautiful feather to Suzanne without making a fuss.\pau=700\
Suzanne thanks the goose politely and gives the feather to the ogre, so he can write to his fiancée.\pau=700\
Now everybody is happy. The ogre has been able to write his letter, the goose has been able to bathe with its chicks and Suzanne has done a good deed.
