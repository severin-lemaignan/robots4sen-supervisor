Today, it's the holidays, and Ben has decided to go to the seaside.
"Eeeeeeeee". "Maybe it's the wind, maybe it's the seagulls," Ben thinks, and he keeps on filling his bucket with sand to build the dungeon of his castle\pau=700\.
"No, a sound like this cannot be the wind, and cannot be the seagulls," Ben tells himself.
So Ben takes his inflatable boat, his flippers, his diving mask and his snorkel, and jumps into the water.
The scream is coming from far away, over there, where the sea is deep blue, almost black.
A little farther, he meets a shoal of sardines swimming fast towards the beach.
"Don't come closer!" the sardines say, frightened, "the white whale is angry".
So Ben keeps on swimming. He is very far by now. On the beach, his parasol is not much more than a small red dot.
Suddenly, a dolphin jumps before him and blocks the way. "Don't go there! Don't go there! The white whale is angry!" says the dolphin.
The scream is so loud that Ben thinks his eardrums are about to burst.
Only then does he feel his boat rising into the air, high, very high.
Ben opens his eyes: he is not on a carousel, but on the back of the white whale! In the blink of an eye, Ben puts on his flippers, his mask and his snorkel, and dives into the sea.
The whale replies by slowly moving its fin. Ben wants to ask why it's screaming like that, but under water with his snorkel in his mouth, he cannot manage to get any words out.
It looks like the whale has understood his question. With its tail, it points at its jaw.
Fortunately, Ben, who doesn't want to get tooth decay like his daddy, always has his toothbrush with him.
The whale, relieved, utters a cry of joy: "Haaaaaaaa". And to thank Ben, it signals him to get back on its back, and with one flip of its fin, sends him sailing all the way back to the beach.
