"Oh, look how cute he is!"Suzanne is showing her mother a little cat which is playing with an empty box on the road leading to the sea.
Suzanne is busy building a sandcastle, when an impressive figure stops before her, blocking the sun.
Suzanne takes the ticket and watches the pirate go on his way with a lurch, distributing his tickets to all the holidaymakers.
It says: "Will you be the winner of The Pirate's Treasure?" In the middle of the ticket is a little silver rectangle that says "scratch here".
Her heart is beating hard as she watches the hidden message gradually reveal itself\pau=700\.
She turns the ticket over. There is a map indicating the location of the treasure.
Mum just happens to have finished her sunbathing and says to Suzanne:"Right, we need to go – I have to do some shopping anyway, there's nothing to eat for lunch".
The supermarket is packed, and Suzanne doesn't know what she needs to do to find her treasure.
The pirate from the beach is there with a microphone in his hand.
The little girl cuts a path through the crowd of grownups and listens to the pirate, making her way to the front row.
The buccaneer approaches, takes the ticket and with a big smile that makes his golden teeth sparkle, grabs Suzanne and hoists her onto the podium, announcing: "And here we have our big winner of “The Pirate's Treasure”!"He congratulates Suzanne, drops a pirate's hat on her head and puts her down inside a big shopping trolley disguised as a buccaneer ship full of cans of cat food of the brand "Pirate"\pau=700\.
"Suzanne, where were you, I was looking for you everywhere". As for Suzanne, she's a bit disappointed by what just happened to her.
First, Mum is very surprised; then she starts to grin. "Well, I guess we"re going to have to adopt someone to eat all that!"Suzanne finds her smile again.
