Ben lived on a big boat. With this boat, he went around the world.
His boat was capsized by huge waves roiling the ocean. The sound of the wind roared in his ears and rain whipped his face.
Fortunately, Ben was an excellent swimmer. He reached the surface, but lost sight of his boat.
All around him, there was only water. The situation seemed desperate, but Ben spotted a pod of whales that had come to enjoy the fresh air of the surface before diving back into the depths of the ocean.
The boy thought it was coming to help him, but as it got closer it opened its big mouth and swallowed Ben whole.
Then the whale spoke to him. "Unlucky little fellow, you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Arrg!""Prisoner? But that cannot be!" thought Ben. "I must find my boat and reach America.
Ben then looked around him to see if something could help him escape.
The whale only seemed to swallow little helpless sailors. There was a table, dishes, cutlery, a fridge, salt, pepper and even chocolate! It was as if the whale had swallowed a whole kitchen before Ben.
Then he thought up a plan. He didn't have much to work with. Looking carefully, Ben spotted three possible exits.
But it was blocked by the far-too-numerous baleens, those strange thin teeth that looked like prison bars.
The closer he got to it, the more the floor became sticky. He really didn't want to go out this way.
Some light filtered through a hole, and Ben concluded that it must lead to the outside.
Suddenly, water started to flood the whale's mouth: it was diving again! Ben had to hurry to find a solution! At that moment, he saw the salt and pepper shakers gently floating next to his feet.
As soon as he said this, he grabbed the pepper shaker and the tablecloth.
At first, nothing seemed to be happening, but after a few moments he felt the whale stir.
And as the whale sneezed, Ben was sent straight up to the hole in the ceiling.
At that height, he could clearly see his boat quietly drifting not very far off.
He let the wind carry him to his boat and skilfully landed on the deck.
"My friends will never believe me! In fact, they must be worried about me being late; I'd better resume my course".
