this morning ben is going mushrooming with his maenad it's been raining the whole week so it's the perfect time for picking them if he collects enough mamma promised to cook a noble just for him so ben searches every single corner of the forest to bring back as many mushrooms as possible the only problem is that ben doesn't know how to recognize them he has to ask that those expert to tell him if the mushrooms he finds her edible because bendito that not all mushrooms are edible some a poisonous so you have to be careful he shows the mushrooms he finds and if dad says yes he puts them in his basket there are different sorts those that grow on the ground and those that grow on tree trunks some that look like trumpets or like flowers red ones yellow ones green ones even purple ones there are some with round hats while others have pointed hats even see some with no hat to all that gives him the names of the mushrooms as he put them in the basket there are more infortunes sheep's feet and chanterelles marie and buffoon imagined that there were so many different types of mushroom as the hour is getting late and he starting to get hungry then besides the pimas mushrooms before going home it would be great he could find a big one to finish off and look there's one right there on a pile of moss then sees the strangest mushroom of the day it doesn't look like any of the others that he has seen up until now first it's bigger much bigger than all the others and when it gets close to it it looks like they're windows drawn on the mushroom with little white lace curtains ben carle his eyes there's even smoke coming out of a hat this is amazing ything i have to show it to dad but as he stepped forward to take a close look he hears a voice saying oh no it's not that to happen again it's always the same you humans always trying to pick my house with your big hands for the fingers is it really that hard to tell the difference between a house and a mushroom from the sound of the voice the person speaking seemed very cross but when he looks around he doesn't see any one downheartedness down to get a bed look and indeed just next to his feet he sees a little elf looking rather angry at forgive me i didn't see you i just wanted to take a closer look at this mushroom yes well i'm aware that you didn't see me you big ones never pay attention where you step this is very dangerous for little people like me and this mushroom as you call it happens to be my home is it but your house is the spitting image of a mushroom have you ever seen a marrow windows and smoke coming out with love no well men neither my boy it's my home and i built it myself it's here that i hear the small animals from the forest when their sick i have forest doctor then finds this fantastic a toridor fancy that is that why you live alone in the woods the others came down seeing the baisingers ed in what he does and is no longer trying to pick his home yes that's why i live here to be able to hear animals when they need me and also because the mushrooms i need to cook by healing potion only grow in this forest i was going out to look with some one i saw you hanging around my house benison one more minute and he would have snatched the poor little else house can i do something to be forgiven well now that you mention it i am a bit tired and i see that your carrying a basket for a mushrooms would you agree to swap it for this basket of chestnuts i picked this morning ben is a bit reluctant to give away on his mushrooms but if that ar help with healing animals then there's no need to hesitate he hands his basket of mushrooms over and takes the chestnuts instead thanks alohas the alf if you have come back here feel free to visit me i would be delighted to welcome you he winks at him he in your mushrooms of course then wink back at the elephant returns to find lamentation for him to go back home or of you done with your mushrooms that asks looking surprised when he sees them instead of having a basket full of mushrooms then has returned with a basket full of chestnuts i changed my mind you replies instead of mahomet i'd like her chest that soup then looks at man who knows this not superis then and been loud by the noise of the car falls asleep with a broad smile thinking about all the animals that will be healed thanks to the mushrooms he gave to the elf
