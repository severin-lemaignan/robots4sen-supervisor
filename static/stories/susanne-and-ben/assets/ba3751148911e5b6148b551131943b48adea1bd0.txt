Suzanne is off to visit her friend Princess Veronica. It's been a long time since they last met, and she is happy to see her.
Today, she doesn't want to play or go for a walk in the park: she has something special to show to Suzanne.
The princess, all excited, shows her an object, but Suzanne doesn't see what the big deal is.
"Is it for this that you had me come?" Suzanne asks. "For an ironing board?"\pau=700\"Yes," the princess replies.
It's a magical one. My father brought it on purpose from China.
The princess rolls back her sleeves, raises her arms over her head mysteriously and utters the magic formula:\pau=700\Ignitus BoardibusLet all the clothes, one by oneBe ironed, folded and put away\pau=700\At first, nothing happens.
Soon, all the clothes in the room are ironed, folded and put away.
She would like to try too, but as there are no more clothes, she tells herself that she"ll try it next time.
The ironing board can't stop, and the processing of clothes keeps on going faster and faster.
It creates a huge traffic jam. The clothes are flying all over the place\pau=700\.
She feels like she's watching a play where all the actors are going crazy.
She even looks rather hopeless. And for good reason, as she cannot remember the magic formula to make the magical ironing board stop\pau=700\.
And talk of the devil: Suzanne sees him approaching, and he doesn't seem very happy.
And he is not alone. Behind him, Suzanne sees the queen in her underwear, the duchess walking barefoot and plenty of others.
She tries to help the princess remember the magic formula before everyone arrives, but it doesn't work:\pau=700\Ironing boardThat is enoughAbracadabraNow you can stop!\pau=700\What should they do? The king and his retinue are getting closer and closer...\pau=700\But suddenly, just besides the window, Suzanne sees the manual for the magical ironing board.
The king enters the room along with all the people who have lost their clothes.
The clothes are ironed, folded and put away, and the magical board is back in its place\pau=700\.
"Let it be a lesson," he says. "You mustn't touch what doesn't belong to you and what you don't understand.
But as you've repaired the damage, I will say no more this time.
"And," he adds laughing out loud, "you should have seen the face of the duchess as she was running after her socks, it was worth seeing!"\pau=700\He then stores the ironing board in a locked wardrobe and takes Suzanne and the princess to get ready for the ball that is to be held that evening at the castle.
