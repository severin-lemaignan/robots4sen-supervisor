Suzanne is off to visit her friend Princess Veronica. It's been a long time since they last met, and she is happy to see her.
As she is a princess, Veronica doesn't have plenty of friends and she waits for each of Suzanne's visit with impatience.
Today, she doesn't want to play or go for a walk in the park: she has something special to show to Suzanne.
She brings her to the floor where the maids do all the castle's laundry\pau=700\.
The princess, all excited, shows her an object, but Suzanne doesn't see what the big deal is.
It's only an old ironing board\pau=700\. "Is it for this that you had me come?" Suzanne asks.
"For an ironing board?"\pau=700\"Yes," the princess replies. "But it's not just any ironing board.
It's a magical one. My father brought it on purpose from China.
Do you want to try it?"\pau=700\Suzanne says yes, even though she doesn't really understand how an ironing board could be magical.
The princess rolls back her sleeves, raises her arms over her head mysteriously and utters the magic formula:\pau=700\Ignitus BoardibusLet all the clothes, one by oneBe ironed, folded and put away\pau=700\At first, nothing happens.
Then, Suzanne sees a pair of trousers and a shirt float in the air and land on the board to be ironed.
Soon, all the clothes in the room are ironed, folded and put away.
Suzanne had never seen someone practise magic; she is very impressed\pau=700\.
She would like to try too, but as there are no more clothes, she tells herself that she'll try it next time.
She turns to the princess to speak to her and... Surprise: she sees the duchess's socks go through the door, along with the cook's apron and the queen's dress.
The ironing board can't stop, and the processing of clothes keeps on going faster and faster.
They are everywhere, coming from every room in the castle. It creates a huge traffic jam.
The clothes are flying all over the place\pau=700\. Suzanne finds it very funny.
She feels like she's watching a play where all the actors are going crazy.
She looks at Veronica to see if she is finding the show as delightful as she is, but on the contrary: the princess isn't laughing at all.
She even looks rather hopeless. And for good reason, as she cannot remember the magic formula to make the magical ironing board stop\pau=700\.
If the king ever finds out what's happening, they'll both get into a lot of trouble.
And talk of the devil: Suzanne sees him approaching, and he doesn't seem very happy.
He is wearing... a towel, which wants to escape too! He was bathing when he saw his clothes fly away through the door of the bathroom.
And he is not alone. Behind him, Suzanne sees the queen in her underwear, the duchess walking barefoot and plenty of others.
Yikes! The magical ironing board has taken all the clothes from the castle, even those being worn by people\pau=700\.
She tries to help the princess remember the magic formula before everyone arrives, but it doesn't work:\pau=700\Ironing boardThat is enoughAbracadabraNow you can stop!\pau=700\What should they do? The king and his retinue are getting closer and closer...\pau=700\But suddenly, just besides the window, Suzanne sees the manual for the magical ironing board.
She reads it quickly and utters the magic formula:\pau=700\Stopibus BoardibusYou've worked wellNow you can take a rest\pau=700\Just in time.
The king enters the room along with all the people who have lost their clothes.
Everything is in order, as if nothing had ever happened. The clothes are ironed, folded and put away, and the magical board is back in its place\pau=700\.
But the king is no fool: "Well, young ladies, what do you have to say for yourselves?"\pau=700\Of course, Suzanne and Veronica don't say a word, and only stare at the king, ashamed\pau=700\.
"Let it be a lesson," he says. "You mustn't touch what doesn't belong to you and what you don't understand.
Especially if it's magical. But as you've repaired the damage, I will say no more this time.
Go and apologise to everyone and everything will be forgotten"\pau=700\.
"And," he adds laughing out loud, "you should have seen the face of the duchess as she was running after her socks, it was worth seeing!"\pau=700\He then stores the ironing board in a locked wardrobe and takes Suzanne and the princess to get ready for the ball that is to be held that evening at the castle.
