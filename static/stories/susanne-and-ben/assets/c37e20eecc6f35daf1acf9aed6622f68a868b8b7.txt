Suzanne was sad. In her bed, she thought about the stories that she liked listening to so much and telling herself before falling sleep, but she couldn't quite manage to remember any.
With all her heart, she wished that they would come back, and at that moment, when she thought the hardest, she fell asleep.
All around her was a giant forest. Wherever she looked, she could only see trees.
No! Far from it! For instead of the green leaves of oaks, maples or even birches, the trees had paper leaves, like the pages of a book.
What an amazing sight. She quietly approached one of the trees.
Curious, the little girl took a closer look at these strange leaves.
The leaves were telling one of her favourite stories. How could that be?At that moment, someone spoke to her.
"It's a place that little children like you mustn't disturb. It's here that all the stories invented by people are kept, before being told at night".
A wolf was standing before her eyes. It was a magnificent beast, like her granny's dog, but with very dark fur and very gentle eyes.
She answered: "I think stories can no longer be told, and people are going to be very sad that they can't listen to them anymore.
"I do know. When you invent a story in your world, here a seed falls from the sky and a tree shoots up.
But when you want to read it again, the only way to bring it to you is to go through a hole in the sky.
Then throw the leaf that tells the story into it. Only then can the story be told in your world".
Are the squirrels sick?" Suzanne questioned. "Don't you worry," said the wolf mirthfully, touched by Suzanne.
If the stories can't make it to you, it's because I've removed all the rungs from the ladder that leads to the hole in the sky".
"Why did you do that, Big Wolf?""You see, little girl, I've had enough of seeing that us, the wolves, are always given the worst role in your stories.
I've therefore decided not to let the old stories be told as long as there is no story where the wolves are goodies".
"Well then, that's very simple!" she said with a big smile. "You just have to help me, and I promise I"ll tell this story to everybody.
The wolf scratched the tip of his snout with his big hairy paw.
Together, they put the rungs back on the ladder, and Suzanne was able to jump into the hole in the sky.
The following evening, her daddy came to see her and tell her a story, but as he was about to open a book, Suzanne stopped him.
"Have I ever told you the story of the wolf from the Forest of Tales?"Her dad shook his head no, and seemed curious.
In the meantime, on the other side of the universe, somewhere in the Forest of Tales, the wolf was smiling.
