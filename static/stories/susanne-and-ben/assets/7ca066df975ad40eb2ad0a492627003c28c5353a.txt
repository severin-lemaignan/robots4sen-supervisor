Once upon a time, there was a world named Aquaria. On Aquaria, there are no mountains, nor forests, nor plains â€“ only an immense ocean.
The inhabitants live on large boats that sail across the ocean, carried by the wind.
Ben likes running very much, but his boat is far too small for it.
Something seems odd to him; he no longer feels the rolling of the waves.
Ben, far from panicking, jumps out of the boat and, full of curiosity, starts exploring the bottom of the ocean.
He starts running, running and running. Still running, he ends up losing sight of his boat.
Not far from him, there's a little pond that has survived the disappearance of the water, and in this puddle a strange creature is going round and round in circles.
As soon as she sees Ben, she lifts her head out of the water and addresses him.
I made a big mistake and I must repair it! I'm the princess Helen, daughter of the mighty king of the seas.
I thought it was a jewellery box. I went out of the palace to open it so that no one would see me.
The current was so strong that the box escaped, and I could only save the key".
"Don't you worry, I will bring this key to your father and find the box, and everything will be all right.
He runs very fast, holding the key in his hand like a treasure.
It's not behind the seaweed, nor on the rocks, not even hidden by the coral.
Hurrah! This is the box!Holding the box in one hand and the key in the other, he now hurries to the palace following the directions that Helen gave him.
The palace is circled by a gigantic water bubble in which all the sea animals have taken shelter.
Ben gets closer. There are fish, dolphins, turtles, octopuses, crabs and all that the ocean contains! In a corner, next to the entrance to the palace, Ben sees a group of mermaids looking very worried.
Ben tells her: "Go find the king; I've got an important message from his daughter!"Quickly, the king comes out of the palace and heads to Ben.
He is impressive and looks very old. After staring at him, the king finally addresses Ben.
What's her message?"Without saying a word, Ben hands him the magic box and the shell key.
A wide smile brightens the king's face, who no longer seems old at all.
"Since it's you who brought the key and the box, let me reward you".
A servant approaches with a pair of boots in hand. The king tells him: "We found these shoes on a wrecked ship at the bottom of the ocean.
Wearing these shoes, you can run on water! Now run home, little sailor; we're going to release the waters of the ocean".
He has just enough time to climb aboard before all the water is released! All then goes back to normal.
This is incredible, the king didn't lie: he can run on water! While he is exploding with joy, a familiar face pops out of the water.
