Today, the weather is beautiful. Fantastic!Dad suggests: "How about we all have a picnic?"Mum approves: "Great idea, let's have a picnic!"Suzanne exclaims: "Lovely, I love picnics!"\pau=700\Everybody is busying themselves to get the picnic ready.
The whole family heads for the beach\pau=700\. The beach is crowded.
"That won't be very easy," Mum says, worried. "Well I don't know â€“ look!" says Suzanne\pau=700\.
A few minutes later, the big cloud has made everyone leave the beach\pau=700\.
Mum approves: "Indeed, let's go". Suzanne exclaims: "Plenty of room for us!"\pau=700\Mum arranges the picnic blanket while Dad puts up the parasol.
"Let's eat!" Dad suggests. "Indeed, let's eat!" Mum agrees. "I'm hungry!" exclaims Suzanne\pau=700\.
Everyone is huddling on the picnic blanket under the parasol\pau=700\.
"This is very tasty," Mum adds. "Yum, yum!" says Suzanne. All of a sudden, a strong gust of wind rises, immediately followed by an enormous wave that washes away the picnic and the picnickers\pau=700\.
"It smells funny," Mum complains. "What happened?" asks Suzanne\pau=700\.
"What on earth is this?" exclaims Dad. "Where are we?" asks Mum.
The torch lights up a small, strange cave\pau=700\. "It smells of fish," Dad says, surprised.
"It's a whale!" exclaims Suzanne\pau=700\. They"re having a picnic inside a whale!\pau=700\"We need to get out of here," Dad declares.
"What"ll become of us?" asks Suzanne\pau=700\Dad walks around to try and find a way out\pau=700\.
"Impossible!" Mum complains. "Can I take a slice of salami?" asks Suzanne\pau=700\.
"Did you find anything?" Dad asks. "Nope, nothing at all," Mum says.
Suzanne starts thinking\pau=700\. She remembers that she once read the story of a boy who was trapped inside a whale and managed to get out\pau=700\.
How can they do this? They have nothing with which to make fire.
"Can I have some pepper?" she asks\pau=700\. "You"d better start helping us find a way out," Mum and Dad scold her.
She empties it on the tongue of the animal and returns to her parents, shouting: "Everyone under the picnic blanket!"\pau=700\The whale starts shaking, and suddenly sneezes very powerfully\pau=700\.
AAAAAAA-TISHOO!\pau=700\After a very nice gliding flight, the picnickers end up on the beach again\pau=700\.
"I do!" Suzanne exclaims. "I think she earned it," Dad says with a smile.
