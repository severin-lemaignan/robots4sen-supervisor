Today, the weather is beautiful. Fantastic!
Dad suggests: "How about we all have a picnic?"
Mum approves: "Great idea, let's have a picnic!"
Suzanne exclaims: "Lovely, I love picnics!"\pau=700\
Everybody is busying themselves to get the picnic ready.
Mum is making a salad, Dad is slicing some salami and Suzanne is putting the cutlery, plates, glasses, salt and pepper (not forgetting the mayo and pickles) into the picnic basket.\pau=700\
The whole family heads for the beach.\pau=700\
The beach is crowded.
"We"ll have to find somewhere else," Dad says.
"That won't be very easy," Mum says, worried.
"Well I don't know â€“ look!" says Suzanne.\pau=700\
She points towards a big dark cloud heading towards the beach.\pau=700\
A few minutes later, the big cloud has made everyone leave the beach.\pau=700\
Dad suggests: "Let's go now."
Mum approves: "Indeed, let's go."
Suzanne exclaims: "Plenty of room for us!"\pau=700\
Mum arranges the picnic blanket while Dad puts up the parasol. Suzanne takes out the cutlery, plates, glasses, salt, pepper, mayo and pickles from the picnic basket.\pau=700\
"Let's eat!" Dad suggests.
"Indeed, let's eat!" Mum agrees.
"I'm hungry!" exclaims Suzanne.\pau=700\
It's getting darker and darker, and the rain is starting to come down heavily.
Everyone is huddling on the picnic blanket under the parasol.\pau=700\
"This is delicious," Dad says.
"This is very tasty," Mum adds.
"Yum, yum!" says Suzanne.
All of a sudden, a strong gust of wind rises, immediately followed by an enormous wave that washes away the picnic and the picnickers.\pau=700\
"It's all dark, now," Dad says.
"It smells funny," Mum complains.
"What happened?" asks Suzanne.\pau=700\
The little girl turns on her small dynamo torch and shines it around them.\pau=700\
"What on earth is this?" exclaims Dad.
"Where are we?" asks Mum.
"Not on the beach, that's for sure," says Suzanne.\pau=700\
The torch lights up a small, strange cave.\pau=700\
"It smells of fish," Dad says, surprised.
"It's damp," Mum notices.
"It's a whale!" exclaims Suzanne.\pau=700\
They"re having a picnic inside a whale!\pau=700\
"We need to get out of here," Dad declares.
"My mobile phone doesn't have any reception," Mum complains.
"What"ll become of us?" asks Suzanne\pau=700\
Dad walks around to try and find a way out.\pau=700\
"Not one single exit," Dad declares.
"Impossible!" Mum complains.
"Can I take a slice of salami?" asks Suzanne.\pau=700\
Mum walks around the cave to see if SHE can find a way out.\pau=700\
"Did you find anything?" Dad asks.
"Nope, nothing at all," Mum says.
"Can I take another slice of salami?" asks Suzanne.\pau=700\
Suzanne starts thinking.\pau=700\
She remembers that she once read the story of a boy who was trapped inside a whale and managed to get out.\pau=700\
That's it, she remembers! The hero had made a fire and the smoke had forced the whale to open its mouth.\pau=700\
How can they do this? They have nothing with which to make fire.
Suzanne has an idea.\pau=700\
"Can I have some pepper?" she asks.\pau=700\
"You"d better start helping us find a way out," Mum and Dad scold her. "Can't you see we"re stuck here?"\pau=700\
Suzanne grabs the pepper shaker and walks towards the mouth of the whale. She empties it on the tongue of the animal and returns to her parents, shouting: "Everyone under the picnic blanket!"\pau=700\
The whale starts shaking, and suddenly sneezes very powerfully.\pau=700\
"Ready for take-off!" says Suzanne.\pau=700\
AAAAAAA-TISHOO!\pau=700\
After a very nice gliding flight, the picnickers end up on the beach again.\pau=700\
"Who wants a slice of salami?" Mum asks.
"I do!" Suzanne exclaims.
"I think she earned it," Dad says with a smile.
