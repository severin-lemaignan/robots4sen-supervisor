Ben is a little fair-haired boy who is seemingly ordinary. He always goes through the forest with his loom.
With his threads, Ben weaves stories and adventures, not mere jumpers and canvas trousers.
Monday is the day for stories about knights, Tuesdays are for pirates, Wednesdays are for dragons, and so on for the rest of the week, until Sundays, when Ben has a rest.
So he has settled himself with his loom next to a beautifully illuminated little pond under a big old oak.
He weaves tirelessly the story of a witch with a great sorrow.
Little by little, the story takes shape before him. As he gets closer to the end of the tale, the witch from his story comes to life.
She grunts and struggles to undo herself from Ben's loom. "Calm down or I will never finish my story and you shall stay attached to me! And if you break the thread that links you to the loom before I finish the story, you're in danger of disappearing! So calm down!" Ben warns her.
She struggles, she twists, she stirs in every way and ends up breaking the thread between her and Ben in order to run away.
But as she escapes, after only a few strides, she falls down asleep on the moss, lifeless.
He tries to talk to her and pokes her softly to wake her, but nothing happens: the witch doesn't move.
He really put his whole heart in the work. It wasn't supposed to end up like this.
Impatient and full of sadness, she couldn't wait for the happy ending of his story.
He starts weaving the story again, but the thread of the witch is all crumpled and cannot fit into the loom anymore.
He seizes his long blond hair and uses it as thread to weave the end of the story, which he pins onto the witch.
He then hurries to finish his story and heal the witch's grief with a happy ending.
She is much calmer than before. The end of the story sewn by Gaston is so beautiful that the witch becomes a fairy again.
Proud of his work, he sits against the old oak, ready to fall asleep.
"I'm sorry for what happened," she says, "but I was so sad that I did not think".
"But all's well that ends well! And this strand of fair hair in the middle of your black hair suits you very well!"Indeed, the strand of hair that Ben used to wake the witch is now in her own, like an ear of corn in the middle of a field of black flowers.
