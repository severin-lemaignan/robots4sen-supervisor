All was quiet in Suzanne's house. So quiet in fact that she could hear the squeaking of a mouse somewhere in the walls.
Tomorrow, school would start again, and to be fair, she was more than a bit scared\pau=700\.
One especially was bigger than the others and Suzanne looked at it for a long while.
When she opened them again, the big star started shining brightly in her room.
She was not exactly pretty. In fact, she looked rather plump, with a dress too large for her and tiny wings that had trouble keeping her in the air\pau=700\.
"I am your Fairy Godmother"\pau=700\. Suzanne rubbed her eyes in wonder.
But stories were often just that: stories!\pau=700\"What are you doing here?" asked Suzanne\pau=700\.
"I've come to grant your wish and help you have a great day tomorrow"\pau=700\.
"Any wish I want? she asked. "Sure, anything!" replied the fairy.
She had sometimes dreamed about this, but she never thought it would actually happen in real life.
"Well, sweetie, they dream of being princesses, of course. Look .
". She grabbed an old pair of slippers lying on the carpet and, with a tap of her wand, turned them into beautiful glass shoes sparkling in the night.
"I can also make you a dress and a crown. You"d be the prettiest princess at school, and all the little princes would be crazy about you.
It was always the same story. Princesses sleeping in the woods, prisoners in high towers guarded by pet dragons, and going to the ball with rats for horses and a pumpkin for a coach.
What a fairy tale!Suzanne cringed just thinking about it\pau=700\.
"I don't want to be a princess, and I certainly don't want a prince.
"But . . . you don't understand, you can be a princess . . ".
She had never met, in her long life, a girl without dreams of a prince.
"I still like the shoe, though!" she said after a while. "But I think I have a better idea than a glass shoe with a high heel, which is uncomfortable anyway!"\pau=700\"What do you have in mind? asked the Fairy Godmother, who was more and more surprised\pau=700\.
The poor Fairy Godmother's mouth hung wide open. "A . . . are you sure?" she asked.
"With that kind of shoe? No thank you! I much prefer my idea".
The next morning, Suzanne woke up, got dressed and put on her special boots\pau=700\.
