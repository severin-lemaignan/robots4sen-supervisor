"I had asked you to buy a snack!" Suzanne's mum is very angry: she just discovered that Suzanne's bag is filled with chewing gum.
Instead of taking some chocolates and apples, Suzanne has bought loads of chewing gum!\pau=700\"I'm very cross!" Mum says furiously.
Suddenly, Suzanne can't see her mum anymore, even though she was walking ahead just a minute ago.
She doubles back, looks right, looks left and stops to see if she can hear her.
Nothing â€“ all she can hear are the birds singing. Suzanne sits on a tree stump to think.
There's no doubt she"ll come back\pau=700\. In fact, she's hearing something now: someone's approaching... it's probably her.
The noise is getting closer. "Is it you, Mum?" Suzanne repeats.
She keeps on chewing her gum as if nothing was wrong. The wolf, with its bright eyes, asks her what she's doing there\pau=700\.
The wolf smiles; he doesn't believe a word of what Suzanne is telling him.
"It's a chewing gum," Suzanne replies. "Do you want to taste?" The wolf seems tempted.
Suzanne places a gum before him. The wolf snaps it up, crunches it, chews it and asks for another, then another, and so on until there's only one left in Suzanne's packet\pau=700\.
It's forming a big, pink, soft, stringy blob in his mouth. Suzanne makes a huge bubble with her gum.
The little girl explains to him what she does to make a bubble.
He either blows too hard or not hard enough. The wolf keeps on trying; he blows just right and makes a wonderful bubble, as big as him.
The bubble explodes on the wolf, who doesn't understand what is happening to him.
"Suzanne! Suzanne!" It's Mum's voice. "Sorry, I think someone's calling me!" Suzanne runs off to catch up with Mum, leaving the wolf wrestling with the strawberry gum.
