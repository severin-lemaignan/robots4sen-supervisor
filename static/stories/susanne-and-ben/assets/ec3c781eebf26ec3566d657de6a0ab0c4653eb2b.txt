Suzanne loves scary stories. Stories of wolves that devour Red Riding Hoods, stories of witches who transform charming princes into toads, stories of ogres who devour little children with the misfortune of having knocked on their door\pau=700\.
She settles herself comfortably on her bed with her favourite chocolates, a strawberry yogurt and an apple juice, not forgetting her new book The Gourmet Ogre.
The ogre is licking his chops at the sight of the children, which he intends to eat for his dinner\pau=700\.
"Eat well," says the ogre to the children, "so that you'll be fatter and more delicious"\pau=700\.
The children have fallen asleep. The ogre goes to find his big knife and his checked napkin\pau=700\.
She starts to feel as though the smallest child is pretending to sleep while gesturing to her.
The ogre turns his head towards the yogurt stain that has just appeared on the book.
Suzanne can't believe her eyes\pau=700\. The little child makes a little sign to her, as if to thank her.
A big smile brightens his face. In the meantime, the little one has woken his brothers up and is leading them out of the room.
He seems happy, with his yogurt all around his mouth\pau=700\.
Suzanne gives the rest of her yogurt to the ogre by spilling it onto the book, just when her mum happens to be coming into her room.
