Suzanne loves scary stories. Stories of wolves that devour Red Riding Hoods, stories of witches who transform charming princes into toads, stories of ogres who devour little children with the misfortune of having knocked on their door\pau=700\.
That day, Suzanne is looking forwards to reading the book she just took out  from the media library, while she takes her snack.
She settles herself comfortably on her bed with her favourite chocolates, a strawberry yogurt and an apple juice, not forgetting her new book The Gourmet Ogre.
Suzanne starts reading the story while biting into a chocolate\pau=700\.
The ogre is licking his chops at the sight of the children, which he intends to eat for his dinner\pau=700\.
Suzanne continues her reading with her chocolates\pau=700\. "Eat well," says the ogre to the children, "so that you'll be fatter and more delicious"\pau=700\.
Now Suzanne has begun eating her strawberry yogurt\pau=700\. The children have fallen asleep.
The ogre goes to find his big knife and his checked napkin\pau=700\.
Suzanne wonders how on earth the children are going to get away from the ogre.
She starts to feel as though the smallest child is pretending to sleep while gesturing to her.
She's so surprised that she spills some yoghurt on her book. The ogre turns his head towards the yogurt stain that has just appeared on the book.
He sniffs loudly towards her, puts down his knife and heads for the yogurt.
Suzanne can't believe her eyes\pau=700\. The little child makes a little sign to her, as if to thank her.
The ogre approaches the yogurt stain, dips his finger in it and brings it to his mouth.
A big smile brightens his face. In the meantime, the little one has woken his brothers up and is leading them out of the room.
The ogre, sat in the middle of the yogurt stain, licks his fingers, eating like a big baby.
He seems happy, with his yogurt all around his mouth\pau=700\.
Suzanne wonders if she is dreaming, until the voice of the ogre shouting "More!" confirms to her that she really just saved the little children.
Suzanne gives the rest of her yogurt to the ogre by spilling it onto the book, just when her mum happens to be coming into her room.
