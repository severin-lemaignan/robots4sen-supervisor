Suzanne read a lot. She loved all books, except those about knights.
It has to be said that she was not the kind of girl to like sewing and being locked up in a tower.
So she didn't understand how a princess could wait for a whole story while someone came to rescue her.
She had never seen it before, even though she often came here to read.
She opened the pages and immediately felt plunged in the story.
Her horse was going very fast and she was riding it very well.
The feeling of the wind slipping against her was very pleasant and exhilarating.
She knew that in the books she read, this was often where the treasure and the princess were hidden, protected by a guardian.
It was one thing to ride a horse, but to challenge the guardian of a treasure or princess was another.
In the stories, the knights proudly entered castles sword in hand, but Suzanne didn't have one... and anyway, she did not know how to fight.
Immediately, a scary-looking old man came to open, apparently ready to fight off intruders.
The sorcerer became all confused: no one ever spoke to him nicely; after much hesitation, he pointed the way towards the highest tower of the castle.
And Suzanne didn't seem to be a dangerous knight at all. Once in front of the princess's bedroom, Suzanne knocked on the door again.
"What's this? A little girl? What are you doing here?""I guess that I'm here to rescue you, Miss Princess".
Like taking my treasure and marrying me without even asking my opinion! I can come and go in the castle as I please, but as soon as I go out I'm surrounded by suitors, and I feel like they"re obsessed by the crown I wear, instead of the person I am.
I can't seem to find anything with which to occupy my time". "I know exactly what you mean, Princess," answered Suzanne.
What I do when I get bored is invent or read stories. There's no end to imagination, I guarantee it! You should try and read for a change!""I've tried, but I cannot read, it gives me headaches and I can't make out all the small letters in the books".
There, try them on and tell me if it helps you," Suzanne said, handing the princess her glasses.
"This is amazing, what was blurred is now all clear! These glasses are magic!""Since you like them, they are yours â€“ I have a second pair at home.
Surprised, she looked over the book, but the pages were all blank.
She had just understood that stories about knights and princesses were sometimes more interesting than they seemed.
