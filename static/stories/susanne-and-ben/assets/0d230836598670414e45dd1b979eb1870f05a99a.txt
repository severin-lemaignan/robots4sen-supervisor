Suzanne read a lot. She loved all books, except those about knights.
She thought that those men in armor were very strong and courageous, but she didn't like the princesses.
It has to be said that she wasn't the kind of girl to like sewing and being locked up in a tower.
She was a daredevil little girl who wasn't afraid of anything,
and she was always the first to climb trees to save a cat, rather than watch others do it.
So she didn't understand how a princess could wait for a whole story, while some one came to rescue her.
One day, when she was at the library, she saw an old dusty book on one of the shelf.
She'd never seen it before even though she often came here to read.
Out of curiosity she grabbed it put on her glasses and settled herself in her favorite spot to read it.
She opened the pages and immediately plunged into the story.
There she was, riding a magnificent white horse whereas a few moments ago she was still in the library.
Her horse was going very fast and she was riding it very well.
It was as if she had always known how to ride.
The feeling of the wind rushing by was very pleasant and exhilarating.
Her horse seemed to know where to go without even needing to be told, and very soon Suzanne arrived at a huge castle on the edge of a cliff.
She knew that in the book she read this was often where the treasure and the princess were hidden, protected by a guardian.
Suzanne got scared. It was one thing to ride a horse, but to challenge the guardian of a treasure or a princess was another.
She dismounted slowly and carefully made her way to the castle.
In the stories, the knight proudly entered castles sword in hand.
But suzanne didn't have one, and anyway she didn't know how to fight.
So she decided to knock politely on the door.
Immediately a scary looking old man came to open apparently ready to fight off intruders.
Although terrified by the sorcerer's long beard and dark eyes, Suzanne wore a broad smile and addressed the old man:
"Hello sir, I've come to visit the princess", she said innocently as if that was the most normal thing in the world.
The sorcerer was all confused: no one ever spoke to him nicely.
After much hesitation, he pointed the way towards the highest tower of the castle.
After all his job was to prevent knights from stealing the princess, not to stop little girls from visiting, and Suzanne didn't seem to be a dangerous knight at all.
Outside the princess's bedroom, Suzanne knocked on the door. "Come in", the princess said. 
"What's this? A little girl? What are you doing here?"
"I guess that I'm here to rescue you, miss princess."
"To rescue me? But I don't need to be rescued!
"I hired the sorcerer to protect me from knights who thought they could do as they pleased.
Like taking my treasure and marrying me without even asking my opinion.
I can come and go in the castle as I please.
But as soon as I go out I am surrounded by suitors, and they feel like there obsessed by the crown I wear instead of the person I am.
The only thing you could rescue me from is boredom, as I already explored the castle and I don't like either sewing or painting.
I can't seem to find anything with which to occupy my time."
"I know exactly what you mean princess", answered Suzanne.
"I don't like that either! What I do when I get bored is invent or read stories.
There's no end to imagination I guarantee you! You should try and read for a change."
"I tried but I can not read, it gives me headaches and I can't make out all the small letters in the books."
"Oh you too! Reading tires my eyes a lot: that's why I wear glasses."
"There! Try them on, and tell me if it helps you", Suzanne said, handing the princess her glasses.
The princess took them and put them on to her lovely nose.
"This is amazing! What was blured is now clear! These glasses are magic."
"Since you like them, they're yours. I have a second pair at home."
All's well that ends well, and as if those had been magic words to end a story, Suzanne found herself back at the library, as if she'd never moved at all.
She looked over the book in surprise but the pages were all blank.
Suzanne went and put the book back in its place and returned home proud of what he had achieved.
She had just understood that stories about knights and princesses were sometimes more interesting than they seemed.
