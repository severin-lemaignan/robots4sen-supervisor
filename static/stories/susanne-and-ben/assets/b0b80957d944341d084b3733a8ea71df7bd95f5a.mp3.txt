to day ben is going for a picnic in the forest with his family it's a huge wildlife park where hunting is forbidden and animals can roam free but today then isn't there to watch animals is there for a picnic with man he prepared some amsanctus sandwiches and sandwiches with avocados and verges for dad whose elegant they are also crisps are passed the salad and cheese for drinks they chose lemonade to the kids and some wine for the dots unclean and art josie at taking care of desert they brought a straw retort and some chocolate loose enough to eat for everybody after lunch the adult staretta then he doesn't want to spend the whole afternoon listening to conversations he does understand goes away to play by himself he played the forester who has to manage on his own he built a cabin with branches of walls and leaves for the roof his cabin is almost ready it's just missing a bed of moss to sleep on luckily he spotted some next to the river soft and thick mass that will be very comfortable he's about to go and collect the moss when he hears a voice shouting for help it sounds like it's coming from the bushes close to where he is some one needs help he hurries to go offer his assistance but when he arrived there he finds himself face to face with a wolf it was the war wholesaling for help then is paralysed with fear may be it was a trick to bring him here what ever wor wanted a goblin up but as he looks closer he sees that a rather embarrassed wolf it looks unhappy and his moaning softly and for good reason its pause a stunt the ground with chewing gum as help me little man the wolf akim i was going to the river to get a drink when i accidentally stepped into this chewing gum he roam with my sticky paw stuck to the ground black you heard me otherwise i would have been stranded all day ben takes pity on the wolf whose a rather sorry sight he looks miserable his fur is dull and he has a very sad voice he has seingnor himself as if he rolled in it i do want to help you but only if you don't eat me he tells the wolf the wolf starts laughing loudly or rather tried to but the trewinion his snout is also glowing his lips together and you can only hear a chuckle coming out of his mouth don't you worry pollutions it only happens in fairy tales if you were a plump rabbit or a tender partridge i might but would don't eat human you have nothing to fear from me you can be sure of that even better i will owe your favour and a wolf always pays its debts then thought that the wolf whose your favour doesn't come every day and in a forest where you never know what could happen in might be useful but even without that he wouldn't have the heart to leave this poor wolf or tangled up in this chewinggum he grabs hold of great handfuls of grass and starts to brush the wolf down to get rid of all the chewinggum he leaves the snout and the poor to last which the most sensitive parts of an animal to the fore you know it the wolf is as clean as a whistle the alfarache him with a determined air bengali tle scared as it decided to keep its promise but all it does is give him a great big lick on the cheek and this time it laughs out loud thank you little man i'm free again to come and go as i see fit in my fur has never been so clean therefore i owe you a favour as agreed if you ever find yourself in difficulty you only have to say these words oh are you there can you hear me and i will come to your rescue as you did for me and as you have a good heart i like to ask you for a donator would you agree to keep an eye on the tourist when they go for a walk in the forest so that other animals will end up trapped like i was lucky for me that you were there when i needed help but every one might not be as fortunate the forest is a wonderful place but it's also very fragile and there are still too many people using it like a rubbish tip would you do this for me then except this important mission delighted that the wolf trusts him and they both go on their way to war into the forest and then towards the picnic table where he's sure the adults must be still chatting away
