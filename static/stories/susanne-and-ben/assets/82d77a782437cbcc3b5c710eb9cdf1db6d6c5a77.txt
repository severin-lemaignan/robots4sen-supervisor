"Follow the guide!"\pau=700\Ben is a bit fed up. He was so happy to visit a real medieval castle; he thought he would be able to walk around it freely, pretending to be a knight, attacking the castle and freeing the captive princess... But no, he has to stay with the herd of visitors and listen to the guide reeling out his chatter\pau=700\.
Ben is lagging behind a little bit, and ends up being the very last one of the group of visitors\pau=700\.
Great â€“ Ben notices a sweet left from the "Yumtreats" pack he got at Suzanne's birthday.
Ben eats the sweet and throws the wrapper to the ground\pau=700\.
He stops and stares at a knight's armour\pau=700\. The group has disappeared into another part of the castle\pau=700\.
Alone, at last!\pau=700\Ben sneaks under the cordon blocking access and settles himself comfortably into the large golden throne facing the magnificent knight's armour\pau=700\.
Ben closes his eyes and starts imagining himself living in medieval days.
He's Robin Hood coming to free sweet Maid Marian\pau=700\. A soft hiss stirs him out of his daydreaming\pau=700\.
Ben cannot believe his eyes: in the middle of the room, a broom is sweeping on its own, cleaning and polishing the floor and working hard to get rid of the paper Ben just threw on the floor\pau=700\.
The little boy doesn't dare move from his golden throne\pau=700\.
As the broom gets closer to him, Ben starts to think he can hear someone sighing\pau=700\.
And yet, he's alone with this broom scattering dust everywhere\pau=700\.
"Anyone here?" Ben asks\pau=700\. "Someone who's sweeping up the papers thrown on the floor by naughty boys!" answers a deep voice that seems to be coming from the broom\pau=700\.
"Talking brooms don't exist," Ben thinks to himself\pau=700\.
What else could it be?\pau=700\All of a sudden, the broom sweeps through a ray of sunlight.
In the flying dust, Ben can make out a transparent shape holding the broomstick\pau=700\.
"Wow! A ghost," he thinks\pau=700\. This is the first time he's ever seen one\pau=700\.
"What's your name?" he asks softly\pau=700\. "I am the Earl of Broccoli.
I used to live in this castle in the thirteenth century, but now I have to do the housework here because of all the naughty boys like you!"\pau=700\"I'm sorry," says Ben .
"From now on I will not throw my sweet wrappers on the floor of castles"\pau=700\.
"Or anywhere else," the voice answers. "Your parents must be getting worried!"\pau=700\"Goodbye, Mister Earl of..."\pau=700\"Goodbye, young sir"\pau=700\.
Ben meets up with the group again right at the moment when the guide is explaining that the Earl of Broccoli, who used to live in this castle, was known for his frightful fits of anger.
