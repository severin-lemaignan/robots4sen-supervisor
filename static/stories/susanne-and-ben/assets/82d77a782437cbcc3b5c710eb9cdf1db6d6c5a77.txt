"Follow the guide!"\pau=700\Ben is a bit fed up. He was so happy to visit a real medieval castle; he thought he would be able to walk around it freely, pretending to be a knight, attacking the castle and freeing the captive princess... But no, he has to stay with the herd of visitors and listen to the guide reeling out his chatter\pau=700\.
Great â€“ Ben notices a sweet left from the "Yumtreats" pack he got at Suzanne's birthday.
He stops and stares at a knight's armour\pau=700\. The group has disappeared into another part of the castle\pau=700\.
Ben closes his eyes and starts imagining himself living in medieval days.
A soft hiss stirs him out of his daydreaming\pau=700\. Ben cannot believe his eyes: in the middle of the room, a broom is sweeping on its own, cleaning and polishing the floor and working hard to get rid of the paper Ben just threw on the floor\pau=700\.
As the broom gets closer to him, Ben starts to think he can hear someone sighing\pau=700\.
"Anyone here?" Ben asks\pau=700\. "Someone who's sweeping up the papers thrown on the floor by naughty boys!" answers a deep voice that seems to be coming from the broom\pau=700\.
What else could it be?\pau=700\All of a sudden, the broom sweeps through a ray of sunlight.
"Wow! A ghost," he thinks\pau=700\. This is the first time he's ever seen one\pau=700\.
"I am the Earl of Broccoli. I used to live in this castle in the thirteenth century, but now I have to do the housework here because of all the naughty boys like you!"\pau=700\"I'm sorry," says Ben .
"Or anywhere else," the voice answers. "Your parents must be getting worried!"\pau=700\"Goodbye, Mister Earl of..."\pau=700\"Goodbye, young sir"\pau=700\.
