Today, the whole class is going for a discovery walk in Sheroom Forest.
It has mushrooms of every kind, shape and colour. The teacher has given the children a warning: some are poisonous, which means it can be dangerous just to touch them.
Suzanne doesn't like mushrooms; she would have preferred looking for a wolf in the woods or picking flowers.
It can't be the teacher, who is far ahead; it can't be her friend Timeo, who didn't come due to his allergy\pau=700\.
She bends down and discovers that it's a tiny little man wearing a red hat that makes him look like a mushroom.
"Is it you who almost knocked me down with a pine cone?" "I'm sorry," says Suzanne, "I didn't see you".
"Not at all, apart from the hat, maybe"\pau=700\. Suzanne regrets not having brought her fairy doll â€“ they could have played together.
"Of course; I'm the guardian elf of this forest. I keep an eye on the men to make sure they don't cause too much damage".
"Wait for me!" Suzanne runs to borrow the teacher's camera. She tells her that she has found a very interesting mushroom.
Suzanne hurries to photograph her unbelievable friend. The elf hasn't moved, waiting for her.
"I must go, the hour is late and the bus is waiting for us. Goodbye, Mister Wood Elf".
She is going to be surprised when she sees the picture of the elf.
"Your picture is very nice, Suzanne; I've never seen such a mushroom, it almost looks like a little man".
