Today is Wednesday, and Suzanne is going to the swimming pool.
Normally, she meets her friends there, but today they didn't come.
Today, Suzanne is a bit bored alone. She approaches the diving pool; it's a very deep, square pool.
When she is with friends, they never go to this pool. "Maybe I could try to jump from the small diving board," Suzanne thinks to herself.
It's actually not that high. There she is, on the diving board.
"I'm not afraid at all," she tells herself. She goes ahead, takes a deep breath and jumps.
Let's try the second-highest board. Suzanne gets out of the water and climbs up the ladder to the second one\pau=700\.
Suzanne looks down. From here, everything seems smaller, even the lifeguard.
She takes a deep breath and . . . Awesome! Suzanne opens her eyes while sinking into the water.
"I must be seeing things," Suzanne tells herself â€“ there can't be a house there.
I must go back! Suzanne wants to be sure. She must absolutely make sure to get to the very bottom of the swimming pool.
Suzanne gets a little dizzy, and if it weren't for the house under the water, she would come back down.
She wasn't dreaming: there really is a small house before her, nestled at the bottom\pau=700\.
She takes the locker key that she's wearing around her neck and sees if it can open the door.
Suzanne is determined to go back, but when her head comes up from the water, she finds herself face to face with the lifeguard, who announces that the swimming pool is closing\pau=700\.
She returns to the pool, and when she hears some splashing sounds, she approaches without being seen to discover a silhouette swimming and jumping in the water.
Suzanne approaches and lets out a cry. She has just discovered that the lady has a fish tail! She's a mermaid!\pau=700\The lady has heard Suzanne, and gives her a big smile.
Suzanne tells her how she lost her locker key at the bottom of the pool.
Then she disappears into the water. The little girl runs to the ticket booth and waits\pau=700\.
The mermaid hands the locker key to her with a smile and makes her promise to keep it all a secret.
Since that day, every time she goes to the swimming pool, the ticket lady always gives her a wink.
