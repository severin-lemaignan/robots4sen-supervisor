All morning, Ben has been riding his mountain bike hard through the forest.
He leans his bike against a tree, gets out a water bottle from his backpack and goes to sit down onto a tree stump to rest a little.
Considering its size, it cannot be a hare, and with such a colour, it cannot be a fox.
The animal is asleep. It is grey and big, has a long thick tail and has a pointed snout and ears.
He really wants to make its acquaintance. He leans towards its ear.
"Leave me alone, little boy," the wolf grunts. But Ben insists.
He hums: "Let's stroll in the woods, while the wolf is not there..." Hearing this tune, the wolf opens his eyes wide and covers his ears.
He starts up again: "Let's stroll in the woods..." The wolf gets to his feet.
The wolf is now fully awake. He's definitely scary, with his piercing blue eyes and sharp fangs.
"So, are you going to try to eat me now?" he asks, ready to run away.
Ben is disappointed: "Usually, wolves eat children". "I told you, I'm not hungry," the wolf says, exasperated.
"At least you could try to run after me," Ben suggests. The wolf lies down.
Let me digest peacefully"\pau=700\. Ben can't understand why this wolf does not want to act like a wolf.
He is so disappointed that he starts to weep, wailing loudly.
Ben, who has never seen a wolf climb trees before, immediately stops crying\pau=700\.
Ben and the wolf silently watch each other for a while. "Sorry, wolf," Ben apologises.
"And you won't sing that annoying rhyme and you won't ask me to eat you again?" the wolf asks, suspicious.
But the wolf is in a bit of a bother. Because the problem now is that he doesn't know how to get down from the tree... Fortunately, Ben's grandmother lives right next to the forest, and she owns a big ladder.
Once the wolf has come down it thanks Ben, and both of them promise to meet up again soon in the forest to play tag.
