When his parents are not home and he is alone with the babysitter, Ben likes to joke around with her.
He insists, drags the babysitter through the corridor and partially opens the closet.
Indeed, it looks like a dragon's tail. "You see? I told you so!" Ben whispers.
"I'm sure it's a dragon!" Ben says, lifting a floral dress. The babysitter cringes.
"Beware, it will surely breathe flames!" the babysitter warns while pulling Ben's t-shirt.
It suddenly opens its mouth, but instead of the expected flames, what looks like some kind of big pebbles of all different colours escape from its mouth and bounce onto the floor, making a "dong, dong, dong" sound.
But the dragon starts crying. Big tears roll down from its eyes, which are not threating anymore\pau=700\.
"I escaped from one of Ben's storybooks because the other dragons are bothering me," the dragon explains.
"They"re stupid," the babysitter replies. "I think that being able to spit pebbles is marvellous".
"These are not pebbles: they"re marbles!" Ben says. The babysitter bends down as well and corrects him: "These are not marbles, but beads!" "What is a bead?" the dragon asks.
"To make necklaces," adds the babysitter\pau=700\. The babysitter looks for some thread and Ben begins to string the beads.
He watches closely Ben's every move. Soon, the pearls form a big colourful necklace.
"I will offer it to Mum when she comes home," Ben says. The little dragon is surprised, and very proud to see his pebbles transformed into a jewel.
"Of course!" Ben makes him a necklace just for his size with red and green pearls, and puts it around the dragon's neck.
He thanks Ben, then adds: "It's time for me to go now". Ben is a bit disappointed.
"I really want to show my necklace to the other dragons". "I think they"re going to be a bit jealous..." the babysitter says.
Since that day, Ben often goes to have a look in his parents' closet.
