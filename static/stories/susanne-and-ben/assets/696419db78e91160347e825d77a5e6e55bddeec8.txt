Suzanne is on a cruise with her parents. She's going around the world, around all the continents and all the seas.
They are going around the island in a boat with a glass bottom.
They can observe fish of all shapes and sizes. There are clownfish that look like they're telling jokes, turtles passing by and even a mermaid who waves at Suzanne.
So when she waves to her to come to the beach, Suzanne doesn't hesitate for a second and goes to join her\pau=700\.
Hide-and-seek behind the algae, or leapfrog over the waves. They play so much that eventually, Suzanne gets tired and hungry.
"Cheddar!" the mermaid exclaims. "It's been years since I ate some.
She had been saving hers for a snack, but she agrees to share it\pau=700\.
"Didn't you? All mermaids love Cheddar. It's even better than sweets; but it's hard to find down here in the sea.
Thank you very much for this snack"\pau=700\. Suzanne is very happy to have pleased the mermaid.
She says goodbye to her friend and promises to come back and see her if she ever returns to Australia, as well as send her some Cheddar from time to time\pau=700\.
She goes to the supermarket, buys a whole box of Cheddar and sends it to her friend's address: 42, Blue Wave Avenue, The Mermaids' Beach, Australia\pau=700\.
