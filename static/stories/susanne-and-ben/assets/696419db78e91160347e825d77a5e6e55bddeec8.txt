Suzanne is on a cruise with her parents. She's going around the world, around all the continents and all the seas. This time, they"re stopping off in Australia, the country of kangaroos. They are going around the island in a boat with a glass bottom. This way they can see to the bottom of the ocean. They can observe fish of all shapes and sizes. There are clownfish that look like they're telling jokes, turtles passing by and even a mermaid who waves at Suzanne. She really wants to come and play with her. So when she waves to her to come to the beach, Suzanne doesn't hesitate for a second and goes to join her.\pau=700\
They have so much fun together. Hide-and-seek behind the algae, or leapfrog over the waves. They play so much that eventually, Suzanne gets tired and hungry. She calls a timeout and goes to sit on a rock to eat her snack.\pau=700\
"Cheddar!" the mermaid exclaims. "It's been years since I ate some. Would give me some?"\pau=700\
Suzanne is very surprised that mermaids know about Cheddar. She had been saving hers for a snack, but she agrees to share it.\pau=700\
"I didn't know that mermaids liked Cheddar," she tells her.\pau=700\
"Didn't you? All mermaids love Cheddar. It's even better than sweets; but it's hard to find down here in the sea. It's been an age since I last got to eat some. Thank you very much for this snack."\pau=700\
Suzanne is very happy to have pleased the mermaid. She would have stayed longer, but it's already time to go home. She says goodbye to her friend and promises to come back and see her if she ever returns to Australia, as well as send her some Cheddar from time to time.\pau=700\
Once home, Suzanne doesn't forget her promise. She goes to the supermarket, buys a whole box of Cheddar and sends it to her friend's address: 42, Blue Wave Avenue, The Mermaids' Beach, Australia.\pau=700\
As she sticks the stamps on the package, she thinks how Gaston will never believe her when she tells him that she met a mermaid who likes Cheddar...
