Ding! Ben's alarm clock chimed. Ding! The alarm clock had been going off for at least ten minutes without the boy moving a muscle.
It was the twenty-fourth of December and Ben was already late.
It was still quite dark outside, but the landscape was covered in a layer of white.
After getting ready, Ben came down to have breakfast. He was overexcited: Christmas was just round the corner! He had been counting down the days impatiently for a month, and there was only one night left before Christmas.
Every year, his daddy told him that decorating the house properly was the least they could do to thank Santa for coming.
Ben totally agreed. Ben was a very good little boy, but not too courageous.
The day was spent putting the tinsel round the Christmas tree, running in the snow or building snowmen and igloos, and Ben was too busy to see the time fly by.
Ben was so excited thinking how close Christmas was that he couldn't get to sleep.
He counted sheep, played with his teddies, imagined his presents, but it was no use: he couldn't sleep! After what he thought was several hours, with the house in silence, Ben had an idea: he could spy on Santa's arrival.
The room was plunged in darkness â€“ except for the discreet decorations on the Christmas tree blinking from time to time.
Nothing happened. He waited again. Still nothing. The little boy suddenly feared that Santa might not come to avoid being seen.
"I'm in a bit of a pickle, and the night is only beginning. There's a spider in the chimney bothering me".
Ben moved closer to the chimney, feeling both curiosity and fear.
"Who do you expect, during such a magical evening? It's only me, Ben: Santa Claus!""Why are you staying up there in the chimney?""That's a good question, isn't it! I'm trapped.
It's a secret, but these beasts frighten me". "I know exactly what you mean," said Ben, "they scare me as well.
"You would face your fear for me? Really?""I have to, for Christmas's sake!" And Ben moved closer to the chimney.
"The way is clear!" he proudly told Santa. "Thank you very much Ben, you're a good boy.
Courage isn't about not fearing the dark, spiders, storms or haunted mansions.
Then Santa stared at his watch and hurried to drop the presents at the foot of the tree.
Ben, his eyes filled with stars and his head filled with gifts, went back to bed and fell into a deep sleep.
