King Totor is very worried: his beloved daughter Tiphaine does not want to read anymore.
But she has refused to read anything for a while\pau=700\. The king comes to see her with all sorts of books â€“ collections of funny stories, cookbooks, romances, comics... she lets them all fall to the ground without even taking a second look at them\pau=700\.
The doctor makes her stick out her tongue, listens to her heart and declares that the princess is not ill\pau=700\.
Ben thinks it is such a pity for the princess not to want to read anymore\pau=700\.
When Ben arrives at the castle, he is brought to the princess's room\pau=700\.
Ben greets her and asks her what she wants to do\pau=700\. "Shall we play dress-up?" proposes the princess\pau=700\.
"As what?"\pau=700\"As a frog?" suggests Ben\pau=700\. "All right!" the princess says\pau=700\.
"Croak! croak!"\pau=700\"Wait!" Ben shouts, getting a pair of round glasses out of his pocket and putting them on Tiphaine's nose\pau=700\.
"I have a book that tells the story of a frog that turns into a prince"\pau=700\.
The king, who is passing by, recognises his daughter despite her disguise, and is delighted to see her reading\pau=700\.
Ben replies that she just needed glasses\pau=700\. "What do you want as a reward?" the king then asks Ben\pau=700\.
"Granted," says the king\pau=700\. "And a new pair of glasses as well, to replace those I gave to Tiphaine, so that I can read too".
