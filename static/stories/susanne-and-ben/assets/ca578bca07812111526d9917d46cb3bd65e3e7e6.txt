Suzanne is jumping and wriggling. She's been this way the whole day.
She can't stop. Tonight is Christmas Eve and Suzanne can't wait until morning to open all her presents.
She fidgets when she decorates the Christmas tree with Dad and is so excited that she almost makes it fall.
Luckily, Dad is there to catch it with his big hands. He almost gets cross because Suzanne is messing around, but he sees that it's not really her fault so he doesn't say a word.
And the tree is very beautiful, all decked out in tinsel, candy canes and baubles.
A real marvel. But Suzanne only has one thing in her mind: the morning when she will unwrap her presents\pau=700\.
Yes, Suzanne is impatient\pau=700\. She gets overexcited when she's preparing the cakes with Mum.
She tries to pay attention, but it's no use. She spills flour everywhere, adds too much salt and not enough sugar, and forgets half of the ingredients.
Mum is about to get cross, but she sees that Suzanne's head is somewhere else.
So she doesn't say a word and takes care of everything. Suzanne can only think of one thing: opening her gifts when she wakes up the next morning\pau=700\.
Yes, Suzanne is impatient\pau=700\. She isn't usually like this, but tonight is a special night... When Santa Claus gives presents to every child in the world.
And Suzanne starts imagining him parking his sleigh on the roof and going down the chimney.
That just can't be easy! What if he got stuck?! But no, with a little effort there he goes, coming out of the chimney.
He puts the toys down at the foot of the tree and leaves to deliver gifts to other houses, where kids like Suzanne are waiting for their toys with impatience\pau=700\.
Suddenly, Suzanne starts to get chatty. She was lost in her thoughts before, but now she goes to see Dad to ask him if he remembered to clean the chimney.
Then she goes to see Mum to ask her to put a plate of cookies and a glass of milk out for Santa.
She starts to turn into a bossy nitpicker: "Is the whole house decorated? Are the cakes baked?" A real bundle of nerves! Mum and Dad reassure her, telling her that everything's ready.
Now they"re just waiting for Santa\pau=700\. The evening finally comes.
For once, Suzanne doesn't sulk when it's time to go to bed. Quickly! Quickly! She slips under the quilt.
Quickly! Quickly! She kisses Mum. No story tonight, she has to go to bed early\pau=700\.
Yes, Suzanne is really impatient\pau=700\. So impatient that she wakes up too early.
It's still night outside, but never mind! What if Santa had already come and gone? She hurries to see under the tree and... yes! Suzanne is full of joy.
All her presents are there wrapped up in bright paper. All but one.
A big, brown, thick leather book with writing on it in big golden letters: "Christmas Book".
Suzanne is intrigued. Maybe Santa didn't have any wrapping paper left.
She opens it and starts to read\pau=700\. Gaston: Board game, plastic soldier repair kitSuzanne: Princess dress, jumping ropeAnd so on, and so on.
It's not a gift for Suzanne at all. It's Santa's list! He forgot it here!\pau=700\"Well, let's see.
Where could I have put that list?"\pau=700\Suzanne turns around and can't believe her eyes.
In front of here is Santa Claus. Who seems to be looking for something...\pau=700\"Excuse me, Santa â€“ is it this book you're looking for?" Suzanne asks him\pau=700\.
He gives her a wide smile and thanks her warmly. "Ah, thank you very much, little Suzanne.
I was rather worried. Without my Christmas book, it's impossible to remember who the gifts are for.
Without you, Christmas couldn't have happened, and all the children would have been very sad.
Now I must dash, or I'll be late\pau=700\. And without delaying any further, Santa picks up his book, rolls up his sleeves and climbs up the chimney.
Everything happened so fast that Suzanne is wondering if she was dreaming.
But on the table, close to the empty plate of cookies and glass of milk, she finds a note: "Thank you so much for the glass of milk and the cookies, they were delicious.
See you next year! PS: Don't forget not to tell anyone that you've seen me for real"\pau=700\.
And Suzanne goes back to sleep. Happy to have pleased Santa Claus.
