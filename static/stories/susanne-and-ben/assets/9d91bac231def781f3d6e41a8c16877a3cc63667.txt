Suzanne has just finished her dinner. "And now, off to bed!" says Mum.
Suzanne gives her shoes one last polish. They have to shine. This morning she opened the last window of the advent calendar.
While putting her shoes in front of the chimney, Suzanne wakes up a spider that was sleeping there.
The spider climbs up the chimney, shrugging its shoulders. Suzanne takes one last look at the fireplace\pau=700\.
What if Santa gets thirsty? Suzanne goes to fill a glass with water and a bit of squash in the kitchen and puts it next to her shoes.

"But what if..." "Now, off to bed!" It's Mum who just interrupted the little girl's thoughts.
"Santa only gives presents to obedient children," Mum says. So Suzanne kisses Mum and Dad, gives one last look at the fireplace and goes to sleep.
It's a little spider dancing on the tip of her nose. She tries to go back to sleep, when she hears loud sounds coming from the living room.
The noise comes from the fireplace. She hears a voice grunting and rubbing sounds.
The spider is there, looking at her with a big smile. Suzanne then directs the beam of light towards the inside of the chimney.
Suzanne rushes into the kitchen to look for some round-tipped scissors and a stool.
"I owe you a debt of gratitude, my child; had I stayed stuck the whole night, lots of children would have had been deprived of presents.
"But I must go, there's no time to lose". Santa drops off Suzanne's gifts and goes back up the chimney.
The morning after, Mum comes to wake Suzanne up. "You know, Santa drank your squash and ate your biscuit.
