In Dominica, there's sea and sun. There are seagulls that sing and a blowing wind.
There are the big ones with huge engines, the small ones with massive sails, those with one hull, those with two and even some with three.
Well, every boat that can be imagined ends up in Dominica one day.
This Dominican sea cop is Suzanne. Suzanne doesn't own a boat; to get around, she rides a dolphin called Dipsi, who is also her best friend.
It's thanks to Suzanne that life is very nice over there. To top it off, Suzanne is very kind and tries to help everybody.
Every year in the summer, there is a great boat competition where all the most beautiful boats in the world parade in the harbour in front of a panel of experienced mariners who reward the most extraordinary creations.
Spoiling the biggest event of the year? Not on Suzanne's watch!So Suzanne jumps on Dipsi and hurries towards Tataquin's lair.
Very soon, Suzanne and Dipsi arrive in sight of Tataquin's boat.
She then hears a big noise. A big noise escapes from the rock, like the sound of a straw sucking the bottom of a glass.
The dolphin does it, and the two companions reach the hull. Suzanne sneaks aboard, taking advantage of the pirates' daily nap.
Hearing Suzanne's cry, Pirate Tataquin hurries out of his cabin and threatens Suzanne with his sword.
"You"re alone and I've got a whole squad to stop you. I'm going to suck up the water from the ocean and all the boats will run aground onto the sand and won't be able to show up for the great competition!"But the pirate underestimated Suzanne.
Tataquin, too confident of his victory, is stunned and topples overboard, falling into the water, where Dipsi awaits him.
She approaches the pump to stop it before all the water is sucked up.
There are some blinking buttons, a big tap and wires all over the place, and Suzanne doesn't want to make any mistakes.
"Tell me how to stop the pump, Tataquin, or you'll end your days in Dominica's jail!" threatens Suzanne.
Suzanne and Dipsi then burst out laughing at the pirate's mistake.
Without delay, she hurries to execute the pirate's instructions and turns off the tap of the huge pump.
Suzanne and Dipsi then return to town, where they jail the pirates.
"Hurry up, let's go to the harbour or we'll miss the competition!" Suzanne laughs, jumping on Dipsi, who then heads to the harbour so that both of them can enjoy the show.
