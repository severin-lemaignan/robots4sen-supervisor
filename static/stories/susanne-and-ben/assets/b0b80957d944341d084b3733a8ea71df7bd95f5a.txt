Today, Ben is going for a picnic in the forest with his family.
But today Ben isn't there to watch animals, he's there for a picnic.
There are also crisps, a pasta salad and cheese. For drinks, they chose lemonade for the kids and some wine for the adults.
They brought a strawberry tart and some chocolate mousse. Enough to eat well!\pau=700\After lunch, the adults start chatting and Ben, who doesn't want to spend the whole afternoon listening to conversations he doesn't understand, goes away to play alone.
He builds a cabin with branches as walls and leaves for the roof.
He's only missing a moss bed to sleep well. Luckily, he spotted some next to the river.
He's about to go and find the moss, when he hears a voice shouting for help.
Someone needs help. He hurries to go and offer his assistance, but when he arrives there, he finds himself face to face with a wolf! It was the wolf who was calling for help.
Maybe it was a ruse to bring him here. What if the wolf wanted to gobble him up?But as he looks closer, he sees that it's a rather embarrassed wolf.
And for good reason! Its paws are stuck to the ground with chewing gum\pau=700\.
"I was going to the river to get a drink, when I accidentally stepped into this chewing gum.
Lucky you heard me, otherwise I would have been stranded all day"\pau=700\.
He looks miserable, his fur is dull and he's speaking in a very small voice.
"I do want to help you, but only if you don't eat me," he tells the wolf\pau=700\.
Or rather tries to, but the chewing gum on his snout is also gluing his lips together, and you can only hear a chuckle coming out of his mouth\pau=700\.
It only happens in fairy tales. If you were a plump rabbit or a tender partridge I might, but wolves do not eat humans... you have nothing to fear from me, you can be sure of that.
Ben thought that a wolf who owes you a favour doesn't come every day.
But even without that, he wouldn't have the heart to leave this poor wolf all tangled up in this chewing gum.
He leaves the snout and the paws till last, which are the most sensitive parts of an animal, and before you know it the wolf is as clean as a whistle\pau=700\.
Has it decided to keep its promise? But all it does is give him a great big lick on the cheek, and this time it laughs out loud\pau=700\.
I'm free again to come and go as I see fit, and my fur has never been so clean.
If you ever find yourself in difficulty, you only have to say these words: “Wolf, are you there? Can you hear me?” and I will come to your rescue as you did for me.
Would you agree to keep an eye on the tourists when you go for a walk in the forest, so that other animals won't end up trapped like I was? Lucky for me that you were there when I needed help, but everyone might not be as fortunate.
Would you do this for me?"\pau=700\Ben accepts this important mission, delighted that the wolf trusts him, and they both go on their way – the wolf into the forest, and Ben towards the picnic table where, he is certain, the adults must still be endlessly chatting.
