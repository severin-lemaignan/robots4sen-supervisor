Today Ben has borrowed three books from the library. He is browsing the first one when he comes upon a sheet of paper folded in four, slipped between the pages.
It's a letter to Santa! "Dear Santa," the letter says, "this year I would like you to bring me a blue bike.
"What a shame to have forgotten that letter in the library book," Ben thinks.
He's going to be sad..."\pau=700\So Ben does not hesitate for a second.
He knows that Santa Claus lives in the North Pole, so he goes straight on.
But Ben is not cold. He must find Santa Claus to give him Barnabas's letter\pau=700\.
Luckily, he encounters a seal, and asks it for directions. But the seal does not know where the house is.
Unfortunately, it does not know exactly where Santa lives either.
This must be one of Santa's elves! Ben approaches him, but the elf doesn't speak English and answers in an incomprehensible language: "Chimbilibilik".
The elf now understands. He makes big gestures, shouting: "Chimbilibilik!" and Ben figures that the elf is telling him to follow him\pau=700\.
It is very dark in these parts. Ben is a bit afraid, but thinks of Barnabas and his bike, and follows the elf.
"Bilik bilk," answers Santa. Fortunately, he speaks English as well, and Ben can tell him the whole story.
"Thanks to you, Barnabas will get his bike for Christmas; he will be very happy," Santa says, and to thank Ben he offers to take him home by sleigh\pau=700\.
Santa Claus flies over the clouds, overtaking the planes, and in a matter of minutes they reach Ben's house.
They say goodbye and Ben jumps into the chimney. Only when he lands in the living room does he hear his mum's voice calling him: "Ben! The bath is ready!" Ben joins her in the bathroom.
