What Ben loves more than anything is collecting treasures. He puts them in his box of drawers, which already contains marbles, sticks, rubber bands, pieces of polished glass, rusty nails, butterfly wings and even a shark tooth!\pau=700\As Ben walks through the countryside today, he finds a beautiful blue feather.
"I'm not a little Sioux, I'm Blue Hawk," shouts Ben. He doesn't even have the time to turn around before a huge hand grabs his ankle and lifts him into the air.
But it's too late. The ogre – because the big hand indeed belongs to an ogre – puts Ben in a large bag and takes him to his castle\pau=700\.
While the ogre goes to fetch a large cooking pot, Ben looks for a way to escape from the castle.
Ben has to find another solution . . \pau=700\. When the ogre comes back with his big cooking pot, Ben is sitting very quietly on the table with his hand over his nose.
"Are you ready to dive into the pot?" asks the ogre with a guffaw.
He keeps holding his nose. "You can wait a while before holding your nose, I have not yet poured the boiling water," says the ogre, amused.
Still, the ogre wonders why this little boy is pinching his nose like that.
"It smells bad," Ben replies. "What smells bad?" asks the big voice.
Probably your feet," Ben answers. The ogre is very upset. No one has ever told him he smells.
"Puahh, it stinks!" shouts Ben. "Really?" asks the ogre. "It's an infection!" says Ben.
"You have to wash your socks. I'm going to help you," Ben offers\pau=700\.
The ogre accepts, too happy that someone is taking care of him.
The ogre immediately bursts out laughing. The more he laughs, the more Ben tickles him, till he can't even breathe.
"I'll stop if you promise me never to eat children again," Ben says, still wiggling his feather.
Ben then stops tickling him and puts the feather back in his hair.
"I did not know that I could laugh this much". And once he has fully calmed down, he asks Ben: "Can you please do it again, Blue Hawk?" So Ben takes his feather and starts tickling the ogre's feet again.
