then is a little fair head boy who seemingly ordinary he always walks through the forest carrying his loom for the truth is like every inhabitant in the forest of broceliande he isn't a boy like any other with his threats ben weave stories and adventures not me jumpers and canvas trousers that's because ben is a tailor of tales monday is the day for stories about nights choosday are for pirates wednesdays are dragons and so on for the rest of the week until sundays when ben has a rest to day in brussels on its friday and friday for ben is the day for witches and fairies so he is settled down with his loom next to a beautifully illuminated little pond under a big old oak there he weaves tirelessly he weaves the story of a witch with a great sorrow a very beautiful which with black hair long enough to reach down to her feet little by little the story take shape before him as he gets closer to the end of the tail the witch from his story comes to life she doesn't seem very friendly she grunts and struggles to undo herself from benson came down here i will never finish my story and you shall stay attached to me if you break the thread that links you to the loom before i finished the story you are in danger of disappearing so came down then one but the upset which doesn't heed his warnings she struggles she twists she stirs in every way and ends up breaking the thread between her and ben in order to rinaway limado i would say into garage she threatens him but as she escaped after one stride she falls down asleep on the most lifeless then hurried towards her very worried he tries to talk to her and pooksack but nothing happens the witch doesn't move then is very sad he really put his whole heart into the work it wasn't supposed to end up like this oh dear not only that but his story of sorrow was supposed to end well but the witch didn't even give him time to finish it impatient and full of sadness she couldn't wait for the happy ending of this story then then decides to take the witch in his arms and returned to his loom he starts weaving the story again but the thread of the witch is a crumpled and cannot fit into the luminare the tailor tails then has a great idea he seizes his long blond hair and uses it as a thread to weave the end of the story which he pins under the which after a few moments a work ben sees the witch waking up slowly he then hurries the finishes story and heal the witches grief for the happy ending as soon as it is sown the witch awakes with a broad smile she is much calmer than before the end of the story soon by ben is so beautiful that the witch becomes a fairy again it took the whole day for ben awed the story and he's very tired proud of his work he sits against the old oak ready to fall asleep the fairy approaches and sits next to him i'm sorry for what happened she says but i was so sad that i didn't think lucky you preferred to flee rather than turn me into a cabbage otherwise that could have been rather awkward for both of us then lass but alas well that ends well and this strand of fair hair in the middle of your black hair suits you very well indeed the strand of hair that ben used to wake the witch is now in her own like an ear of corn in the middle of a field of black flowers the laughter of the two children rises into the forest bringing out the end of the day in broceliande
