"The bath is almost ready!" announces Mum. Ben runs into the bathroom, quickly undress and jumps into the bathtub.
He prepares his boat, fixes the pirate flag at the top of the mast and sets the treasure at the bottom of the hold\pau=700\.
Ben goes to turn off the tap, but the pirate stands in his way and draws his sword, looking menacing.
"But the tub will soon overflow," explains Ben, pushing the pirate with his hand.
Surely he isn't going to let himself be pushed around by the tiniest of little pirates.
"Turn off this tap or my crocodile will gobble you up for dinner!" Ben warns.
Ben no longer knows what to do to stop the disaster...\pau=700\Of course, Ben's mum arrives at that very moment.
"Ben, don't you see that the bathtub is overflowing?!" "It's him!" Ben protests, pointing at his pirate.
"There's nobody in this bathroom but you!" How can Ben explain to her that the one responsible for this flood is this dastardly plastic pirate? Who, by the way, seems to have vanished.
Ben doesn't know what to say...\pau=700\Mum is very angry. She gets Ben out of the bath and gives him a towel to mop up the water.
He tosses and turns in his bed, unable to get to sleep, when he hears a little noise close to his pillow.
"Sorry for what happened, sailor," the pirate whispers. "I didn't mean to provoke such a storm".
