The king isn't happy. The castle's stocks of yogurt keep disappearing.
She adores yogurt and will be very disappointed if she can't eat some for her birthday meal\pau=700\.
It is Ben\pau=700\. "I charge you to solve this problem," he tells him.
You have until tonight to find the guilty party and the stolen yogurt.
Ben takes his leave from the king and starts conducting his investigation.
He begins to inspect the basements where all the castle's supplies are stocked.
A genuine Ali Baba's cavern. He spends the whole morning there – a whole castle means many mouths to feed – but he finds nothing\pau=700\.
There too he finds food everywhere. On a spit, over a huge fireplace, a whole wild boar is being roasted.
The only thing missing is the yogurt. He asks the cooks, but they haven't seen anything.
Even though they lock the yogurt up in fridges, it always disappears\pau=700\.
He searches everywhere, and finally finds small traces of yogurt going out of the kitchen.
They lead to the attic. Ben hurries – it's already the afternoon and there's not much time left until the evening\pau=700\.
He opens it suddenly. Before him, caught red-handed, an ogre!Usually, Ben would have been frightened by an ogre, but this one is very small.
"So, it's you who's been stealing all the castle's yogurt?""Indeed, it is," the ogre answers in a small voice.
I thought that as there's a lot of calcium in yogurt, if I ate a lot of it, I could become as tall and as strong as them"\pau=700\.
They arrive just in time for dessert. The king is already red with anger because Ben is late, but when he sees him arriving with his new friend, he guesses that he has solved the mystery\pau=700\.
So he decides to forgive him – providing he no longer pilfers the stocks – and even offers him a job cooking at the castle, where he can invent some new yogurt recipes for the very great pleasure of the queen.
