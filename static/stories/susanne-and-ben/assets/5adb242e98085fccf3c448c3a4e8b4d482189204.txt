Today, Ben is walking in the forest and looking for hazelnuts, when he realises that he has lost his key ring.
Ben goes back to the hazel tree where he had stopped at the beginning of his walk.
The ground is covered with leaves of red, yellow and orange. But the key ring is nowhere to be found.
"Sir, are you looking for something?" it asks Ben. "A shrew is calling me “sir”, how strange..." he thinks to himself.
"Doesn't ring a bell," the shrew answers, "but let me give you this".
He has no idea what he could do with this empty box, but he doesn't dare refuse this present.
The shrew gives him a bow and trots away\pau=700\. Then, Ben decides to go back to the pond where he stopped for a rest.
That's when a beaver surfaces from the water. "You look like you"re looking for something," says the beaver.
"I'm looking for my key ring," Ben tells him. "I didn't find anything of the sort," the beaver answers, "but here are a few branches cut out by my own efforts, should you wish".
He takes the pieces of wood, and no sooner has he thanked the beaver than it dives back into the water\pau=700\.
No key ring to be found there either. As he is about to leave, an acorn drops on his head and he hears a shrill little voice say: "Are you the one who's picking hazelnuts?"\pau=700\On the branch just above, there is a squirrel staring at him in a funny way.
You haven't found it, by any chance?" "Is it something edible?" the squirrel asks.
"Well, then, I'm not interested," the squirrel snaps back. "As you"re not the hazelnut thief, here is an empty nutshell for you".
He heads towards the path that he took in the morning. Surely the key ring fell over there.
"Have you lost something?" it asks. "My key ring," Ben answers.
Ben doesn't understand what it means. "Really, animals speak in the strangest way in this forest," he thinks to himself.
"And go through this path". Ben doesn't really see the point of such a present, but he doesn't dare refuse.
It's getting late now. Night is about to fall. "I"d better go home," Ben thinks.
Ben draws closer and discover a tiny elf crying. Ben asks him what's making him so sad.
"I have nowhere to go". Ben doesn't know what to do. But then he looks at all the presents given to him by the animals and has an idea.
With the empty nutshell from the squirrel, he makes a stool. With the cut branches from the beaver, he builds the walls of the house, and covers them with the moss from the young wild boar so that the rain won't get inside.
He's so happy that he absolutely wants to give Ben a present.
