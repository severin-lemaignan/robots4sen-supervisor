Today, Suzanne is picnicking in the forest with her parents. They brought a chicken and some crisps.
But what she likes most with her chicken is mayonnaise. After this delicious picnic, as it is a warm day, Mum and Dad decide to take a nap before exploring the forest.
Mum and Dad fall asleep immediately. Suzanne isn't very happy to have to wait until her parents wake up.
Suzanne takes her backpack and her compass, her penknife and her gourd, and as she is still a bit hungry and she loves it, she puts the mayonnaise jar into her bag.
That's why Suzanne, as an experienced explorer, brought a spool of thread\pau=700\.
Suzanne ventures into the thickets and down the trails, still holding the precious spool of thread.
She gets closer and sees an old woman leaning down, complaining over a puddle.
She hears the old woman sighing. "Drat, how I wish I could be beautiful! But it is what it is: my skin is all dried and wrinkled, I'm ugly and I scare everyone!" Crack... Suzanne just walked on a twig\pau=700\.
"Well, well, it looks like I have a visitor," she says "Hello, Madam".
"How well-mannered this child is. What's your name?" "Suzanne, Madam".
"Oh, really?" The witch is all ears. "I have here a miracle beauty cream".
Suzanne takes her mayonnaise jar out of her backpack. She instructs: "Apply 'Mayobelle' to your face and wait fifteen minutes before putting on the second layer".
"If it doesn't work, I"ll turn you into a frog," warns the witch.
Suzanne rewinds the thread around the spool and doubles back.
"So, shall we go?" asks Dad. "What if we went to the museum instead?" Suzanne suddenly proposes\pau=700\.
"Well I never, what happened to you, have you been transformed by a fairy?" Mum says.
