Atishoo! Atishoo! Atishoo!\pau=700\Ben caught a cold. Not surprising, in this castle full of drafts! Had he known, he would have gone on a cruise around the world with Suzanne, rather than to a castle in Scotland.
First, no Loch Ness Monster, no pixies and no ghost either. Who could have thought that there would be neither Loch Ness Monster nor pixies in Scotland? And no ghosts in a castle? Unbelievable! Ben feels betrayed, he who likes adventurous holidays and is now stuck inside because of the rain.
"Since there's nothing to do outside, might as well check out the castle," Ben thinks to himself.
The mere thought makes him smile again, and he decides to explore the rooms of the castle one by one, starting with the stables\pau=700\.
And it's also cold out there, which isn't good for Ben's cold, and now – schprmmf! schprmmf! schprmmf! – he can't stop sniffing\pau=700\.
He looks behind the huge medieval tapestries in search of any secret passages.
No secret entrance, no secret passage, no hidden door. This castle is definitely rather depressing!And the dust disturbed by his investigations doesn't help with the sneezing\pau=700\.
He then comes to the castle's armoury, where all the ancient suits of armour, swords and shields are stored.
If he could he would try them all on and pretend to be a knight rescuing his princess\pau=700\.
He's about to leave the armoury when he sees a forgotten hat on a bench.
This could really be handy for Ben, to help keep out the cold.
And immediately feels better!\pau=700\When he opens the door to leave, Ben can't catch the handle.
Crikey! Here he is, stuck in the armoury. But wait a minute. His hand went THROUGH the handle? How is that possible? He tries again and yes, his hand goes through the handle once again, even through the door itself.
Ben has turned into a ghost. He scratches his head to think, and in doing so knocks his hat to the floor.
Incredible! The hat has the power to transform him into a ghost.
With a big joyful whoop Ben rushes through the castle making whooo noises.
No need to look for secret passages now, he just has to go through the walls.
