Suzanne has a loose tooth. It is the first time. With her tongue, she makes it go back and forth.
After being played with enough, the tooth ends up falling out.
She carefully wraps it up in a tissue and puts it in her pocket\pau=700\.
"My tooth has fallen out!" They both tell her that it is good news, that it means she's a big girl and that another tooth is going to grow in its place.
Suzanne doesn't want a fairy to take her tooth at all, but she is curious to see what she looks like\pau=700\.
Then she puts the card next to her pillow and falls asleep. In the middle of the night, Suzanne is woken up by the birthday card music.
The little girl turns on her flashlight and finds herself face to face with a small fairy, very surprised to see her\pau=700\.
"I only come for fallen teeth". "I know," replies Suzanne, "but I wanted to see what you looked like, and if it's all the same to you, I'd rather keep my tooth".
"Well, my job is to collect teeth. If I go back without a tooth, I"ll lose my job"\pau=700\.
This fairy is rather nice, and she wouldn't want her to get in trouble on her account....
Suddenly, she remembers that she might have a solution to the problem in her joke box.
Suzanne comes back with a wonderful set of false Dracula teeth.
Suzanne helps the fairy put the set of false teeth in her small bag.
Suzanne falls asleep with her tooth in her hand, whispering: "Thank you, Dracula".
