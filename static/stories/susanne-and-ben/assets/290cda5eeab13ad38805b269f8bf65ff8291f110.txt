In the highest tower of a very old castle lives a princess who does not look like other princesses.
But her father, a very strict king, forbids her to go out of the castle\pau=700\.
She would so much love to climb trees, bathe into the river, cycle around the countryside and ride a scooter on the paths, as the other children do\pau=700\.
The birds are singing and a very soft wind caresses her arm. It's spring! The princess goes down the stairs and runs to see her father.
"The leaves might be growing, the birds might be singing and the sun might be shining, but a princess must remain in her tower"\pau=700\.
She is so sad that she starts crying and crying. The tears begin to create a small puddle, then a big one, and finally an actual river, which starts flowing under the door.
"Well, well, there must be a leak somewhere," he thinks to himself.
At that moment, the drawbridge is slowly lowered, for a visitor has presented himself in front of the guards.
"You can go in!" the guard shouts to him. But as soon as he passes the drawbridge, a huge river coming from the tower carries him away.
Ben is floating, with alongside him all the furniture of the castle: tables, chairs and beds.
Suddenly, Ben hears a little voice yelling: "Help! I cannot swim!" It is the princess! She tries to grab the railing of the stairs, but a big wave of tears carries her away.
"It's the door to my room!" the princess says. "It will make a good raft," Ben replies\pau=700\.
"What is your name?" the princess asks. "Ben". "For so long I've dreamed of going off on a journey," the princess exclaims.
"To Australia!" the princess answers. "All right," Ben tells her.
"I will show you how to fish," Ben says. "And how will we cook the fish?" the princess wonders.
"And will you also teach me how to roller-skate?" the princess asks.
