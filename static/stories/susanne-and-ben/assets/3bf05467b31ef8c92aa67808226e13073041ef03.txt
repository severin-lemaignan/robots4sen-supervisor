Once upon a time there was a family called the Dufeuils. First there is Mum Dufeuil, who makes shirt buttons.
Then the first Dufeuil child, who makes shirt arms. The second one makes shirt busts.
The whole family works to make Dufeuil shirts, which are the most beautiful shirts in the world.
First of all, she's way too young to work, but she also doesn't like shirts.
Everyone is very busy in the family, but little Suzanne has to be looked after.
She comes every day, after lunch, to teach Suzanne and to play with her until supper.
She is one of the few people she sees who isn't from her family.
These are their secret names, which symbolise their friendship and closeness.
They receive lots of orders for short-sleeved shirts for the summer and they never stop working.
On her birthday, Suzanne acts normally, thinking that her family is planning to surprise her.
During lunch, no cake for Suzanne, no gifts either. She doesn't eat anything and runs to her bedroom.
Chloe finally arrives. When she sees that Suzanne isn't playing in the garden, nor watching TV in the living room, nor reading in the kitchen, she realises that there's something wrong.
She finds the little girl crying, curled up on her bed. She comes closer and put a reassuring hand on Suzanne's back.
Chloe then takes the little girl in her arms. "Come over here, I'm sure they haven't forgotten about you, Suzy.
What would you like for your birthday?""I would have liked a dress and some jewellery, so that people might notice me, Chlo," Suzanne then replies, not crying anymore.
Together they go through the house, picking up here and there a golden button on a table, a pretty piece of cloth or a very beautiful ribbon.
"This jewellery, Suzy, is only for you – you won't see it elsewhere else," Chloe tells her.
Suzanne cannot believe her eyes, and­ the incredible jewellery they've made just from those bits and bobs.
But as they go down the stairs, the lights are suddenly turned off and then turned on again, to reveal the entire Dufeuil family waiting for them in the entrance hall.
And in their hands, they"re holding a splendid Dufeuil ruffle dress.
The first Dufeuil dress for Suzanne Dufeuil!"Once again, Suzanne collapses in tears, but of joy this time.
Chloe, you're invited to the party, of course," says Daddy Dufeuil.
