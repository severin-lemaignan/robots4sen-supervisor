suzanne was sad lying in bed she thought about the stories that she liked to listen to so much and tell herself before falling asleep but she couldn't quite manage to remember any some one or something prevented the stories from coming to her with all her heart she wished that they would come back and at that moment when she thought the hardest she fell asleep when Susanne woke up she wasn't in her bed any more all around her was a giant forest wherever she looked she could only see trees but they weren't normal trees no far from it for instead of the green leaves of oaks maples or even birches the trees had peoples like the pages of a book suzanne marveled at them what an amazing sight she quietly approached one of the trees its branches were hanging to the ground curiously the little girl took a closer look at the strange leaves very soon she uttered oh in surprise putting a hand to a mouth the leaves were telling one of her favorite stories how could that be at that moment some one spoke to her the voice was deep and low like thunder what you doing in the forest of tales little girl the voice said it's a place that little children like you mustn't disturb it's here that all the stories invented by people accept before being told of night suzanne around a wolf was standing before her it was a magnificent beast like a granite dog who with very dark fur and very gentle eyes suzanne understood why she had arrived in the forest of tails she answered i think were no longer able to tell stories and people are going to be very sad that they can't listen to them any more do you know why this is happening before the wolf's eyes darkened i do know when you inventory in your world here a sepolcro the sky and a tree should sup this tree tells a story but when you want to read it again the only way to bring it to you is to go through a hole in the sky and for that a squirrel teller has to take a leaf from the tree and climb up the ladder that leads to the hole then throw the leaf the tells the story into it only then can the story be told in your world but this doesn't explain why the stories on making it back to us a discursive seased don't you worry said the wolf mirthfully touched by cezanne the squirrels are just fine if the story is can't make it to you it's because i've removed all the runs from the ladder that leads to the hole in the sky Susannenah did you do that make more you see little girl i've had enough o seeing that we the walls are always given the worst roll in your stories were always the bodies i therefore decided not to let the old stories be told as long as there is no story where the walls are good is suzanne laughed happily well then that's very simple she said with a big smile you just have to help me and i promise i'll tell this story to everybody give me the rungs of the ladder and you will be a hero for all the children who like stories the wolf scratched the tip of his snout with his big hairy poor after a long silence he declared i am going to trust you but don't let me down little girl together they put the runs back on the ladder and suzanne was able to jump into the hole in sky as soon as she done this she woke up in a bed night was over the following evening he did came into tolerator with as he was about to open a book suzanne stopped him teddy she said with her tin in little voice have i ever told you the story of the wolf from the forest of tails a dad shook his head and securis suzanne started her story once upon a time in the most magical of forest a wolf who looked after the stories of the world and she carried on to tell him how the wolf had saved the stories from oblivion and free the wall from their bad image in the meantime on the other side of the universe somewhere in the forest the tales the wolf was smiling in front of him a new tree was shooting up and he knew that this tree would tell his story forever
