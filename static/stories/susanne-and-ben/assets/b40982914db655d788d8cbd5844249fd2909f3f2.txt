"Oh dear! My appointment is in half an hour and she has yet to arrive!"Ben's father was pacing in the living room.
But the babysitter was not coming. And should Ben's father wait any longer, he would be late.
He was worriedly rubbing his chin. Ben jumped up from the sofa, went up to his daddy, put his fists on his hips and said:"Dad, I'm a big boy.
Ben's father didn't seem very convinced. He was worried about leaving his son alone in this house.
"Okay, Ben," he said, bending down to his son's eye level, "you're a good boy and I'm counting on you not to make mistakes until the babysitter arrives.
With this, he grabbed his suitcase and left the house. He rushed to his car and drove away.
He went to find his teddy: a one-eyed polar bear. He started playing pretend adventures with him.
The chase led him to the attic. This was the place where his parents kept their childhood belongings.
Ben didn't often go into the attic and he was intrigued by the big trunk, which looked like a treasure chest.
Inside he saw old soldiers and dolls that had been worn by time.
He took it and emptied it onto the floor of the attic to play with.
He sat on the trunk, looked at the marbles on the floor and suddenly felt very alone.
He found himself hoping the babysitter would arrive, but she still wasn't here.
He grabbed them. How beautiful and bright they were!Ben laid them on the floor.
POOF!A cloud of smoke appeared. Frightened, Ben let his teddy go, which fell in the cloud of smoke.
But his teddy got up from the smoke and started moving. Even better, it could now speak!It addressed Ben: "Pom pom pom, ah Ben, it pleases me to be able to talk to you at last.
Then Ben had an idea. He looked among the marbles for one to act as an eye for his teddy bear.
He seized it and handed it to the bear, who took it within his big paws and stuck it in the place of his missing eye.
"I can now keep an eye on you! I understand you've been chased by a dragon.
In the evening, when his father came home, he found his son under his sheets playing with his bear.
His father asked him: Ben, did everything go well? Did the babysitter come?""Don't worry," Ben told him with a mischievous smile, "I had the best babysitter ever".
His father started laughing at the little boy's imagination. Then they both went to the kitchen to cook dinner.
But at that very moment the bear, which until now had sat completely still, winked at him and stood up to greet him.
