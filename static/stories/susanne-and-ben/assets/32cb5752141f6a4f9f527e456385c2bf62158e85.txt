"This is for you!" says the babysitter, handing a small cloth bag to Suzanne.
So they settle themselves in front of the living room wall. "The one who makes the marble slide closest to the wall wins," explains Suzanne.
It's Suzanne's turn to flick the transparent marble: she delicately pushes it with her finger and it rolls, rolls, rolls, and... disappears! How is that possible? Taking a closer look, Suzanne discovers a tiny little hole in the wall that she has never seen before.
At that moment, the house starts to vibrate. They hear a noise like a huge engine.
The babysitter hurries towards the window. "We're taking off!" she exclaims.
Soon, through the window, they can see that the garden is now only a tiny green square, and the road nearby just a thin grey line... "Where are we going?" asks Suzanne.
"Shall we have a snack, while we wait to land?" Suzanne suggests\pau=700\.
Through the window, they can see huge green leaves blocking the view.
The babysitter hesitates, but Suzanne has already opened the front door and is stepping outside.
The vegetation is very dense and they struggle to break through.
Suddenly, the babysitter shouts. There, close by, just a few metres ahead, a black panther is watching them from the corner of its eye.
Suzanne grabs her hand and leads her into the bushes. But it's too late.
Fortunately, at the same time, a chimpanzee swings down from a vine and scoops them up\pau=700\.
The babysitter struggles to catch her breath. Suzanne starts to climb the branches looking for a way to come down from the tree.
It's a toucan with a multicoloured beak that has just landed next to them and that is signalling them to climb on its back.
But the boa is approaching. So Suzanne grabs the babysitter and gets on the toucan, which takes flight.
She's never had so much fun. She wishes this trip over the jungle could last forever\pau=700\.
Suzanne doesn't want to go back in. So the babysitter takes her by the arm and makes her go in.
"Try to roll it into the hole, and hurry up, because I think the panther is still prowling the house".
She concentrates with all her might to aim well. And poof: the ball slides into the hole on the first attempt.
A few minutes later, the house lands safely in the garden, just in time for Suzanne's mum to come home from work.
Suzanne runs to open the door. "Everything went well?" asks Mum.
"We were playing marbles," adds Suzanne, giving a sly wink to her babysitter.
