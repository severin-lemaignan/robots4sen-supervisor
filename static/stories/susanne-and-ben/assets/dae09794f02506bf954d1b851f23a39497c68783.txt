"Lunch is ready!" shouted Suzanne's mum through the window. Suzanne pretended no to hear her.
She was too busy having fun among the rocks looking for crabs to put in her bucket.
She resumed her route, jumping from one rock to another, and when she was about to give up on her hunt to go and eat with her parents, a deep and warm voice addressed her.
You over there, couldn't you help me?"Suzanne stopped short; it seemed to her that there was nobody on the beach except her.
"Over heeere," said the voice. "In the waaater". Suzanne turned again towards the sea.
A huge whale, over ten metres long, was staring at her with big eyes, still wet from the ocean's water.
Little girl, can you come and give us a scratch with your rake?"Suzanne, who was a courageous and very kind little girl, approached the whale at the very edge of the rock and said: "Madam Whale, I do not know what a baleen is.
"They are the teeth of whaaaales," answered the huge creature.
"Oh, that's not working, I'm still aching!" the whale complained.
"You don't brush your teeth with a rake! Wait for me here, I'll be right back".
Once there, she slipped, without her mother noticing, into the bathroom.
She tried again to brush the baleens with her toothbrush, but that didn't work either, and the whale was still sad.
It's surely good enough for your little teeth, but mine are huge and numerous.
Suzanne then got an idea. She said: "Wait for me here, I'll be right back!" She left her toothbrush and toothpaste and ran as fast as possible to her house.
The broom was twice as big as she was. She left the house and returned to the whale.
But hurry up, or I'm going to get tooth decay!"Suzanne emptied the tube of toothpaste onto the broom, then at the very edge of the rock, she started brushing the baleens.
"Aaaaah, at last my teeth will stop aching and my breath will be fresh!" the whale said.
It was hard work for a little girl like her. Soon, the creature's teeth became more sparkly than a precious stone, and Suzanne could almost see her reflection.
When she finished, the whale thanked her and offered to take her for a walk.
They were starting to lose patience. The whale then said: "If you want to see me again one day, just whistle three times under water and I'll hear you.
And on that promise, the whale spat out a jet of water and went on its way.
Come night-time, as Suzanne was about to fall asleep, she heard her mother complaining: "Suzanne, you've finished the tube of toothpaste once again without telling me so!" And Suzanne couldn't help but laugh, thinking of the whale.
